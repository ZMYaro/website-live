					<aside style="font-style: italic;">Co-written with Anne Griepenburg.  Originally posted to <a href="https://bostoncyclistsunion.org/introducing-the-landway" target="_blank">Boston Cyclists Union</a>.</aside>
					
					<p>
						One of the most recognizable maps of Boston shows the T with each line a unique color.
					</p>
					<figure>

						<figcaption>Guess what year this is from!</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Subway maps pack a lot of information into an iconic image that answers your top public transit questions: What line do I take?  Where do I transfer?  What is the stop before I need to get off the train?  The actual city doesn't look anything like the lines on a subway map but it is effective because it shows you the <strong>network</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						As travelers trying to navigate on bikes, scooters, mobility devices, and so on, we have similar questions.  As our cities build out &ldquo;micromobility&rdquo; routes, we encounter the frustration of places where they don't connect.  Imagine the Red Line with no tracks between Central and Kendall&mdash;it would make it very hard to plan your trips between downtown and Harvard Square, and you might give up on the subway altogether!
					</p>
					
					<hr />
					<p>
						It can be difficult to create a new reality if you can't visualize it.  Talking about the need for a local &ldquo;bike network&rdquo; doesn't convey the pieces to build and the places to connect.  In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woFlJx7Rv78" target="_blank">Tom Babin's video about the Paris réseau vélopolitain</a>, he discussed how people there tackled that challenge, and one approach they used was conveying the connections the network would provide in a format people were already familiar with: a subway map.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="https://zmyaro.com/blog/2025/05/16/imgs/paris_reseau_velopolitain.jpg" alt="The Paris en Selle réseau vélopolitain shows 10 proposed micromobility routes through and around Paris styled like metro lines." />
					</figure>
					<p>
						I was inspired to try the same thing here, starting in Cambridge and adding from there.
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="https://landway.BostonCyclistsUnion.org" target="_blank">This is the current vision for the Cambridge + Somerville &ldquo;Landway&rdquo;</a>&mdash;the network of off-street paths and separated micromobility lanes people of all ages and abilities can use, especially if they feel unsafe sharing street space with cars and trucks:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="https://zmyaro.com/blog/2025/05/16/imgs/landway_map_v12_camberville_future.png" alt="The, Someday, version of the Camberville Landway map shows 20 major and minor routes through and around Cambridge and Somerville styled like M B T A subway lines.  Icons show people using skateboards, rollerblades, onewheels, handcycles, wheelchairs, scooters, and bicycles." />
					</figure>
					
					<h2>What this map isn't</h2>
					<p>
						Like a subway map, this isn't meant to be 100% geographically accurate or show every precise street-level detail.  As a subway map doesn't tell you station layouts, that abstracted, bird's eye view doesn't address precise design choices such as intersection design, which play massive roles in micromobility safety!  What it <em>does</em> do is show how the broader network will enable cross-town connections between myriad noteworthy destinations for people of all ages and what missing pieces will get us there.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="https://zmyaro.com/blog/2025/05/16/imgs/1947_transit_map.jpg" alt="An old, more geographically accurate Boston transit map shows elevated railway and streetcar routes twist and turn along the streets and rivers they follow." />
						<figcaption>Before the T map we know today, more precise maps were also more complicated</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<h2>Where are we now?</h2>
					<p>
						Obviously the network is currently far from complete.  This is what we have at time of writing:
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="https://zmyaro.com/blog/2025/05/16/imgs/landway_map_v12_camberville_current.png" alt="The, Current, version of the Camberville Landway map shows most of the lines missing large sections and disconnected from each other." />
					</figure>
					<p>
						Many people ask why the increase in people choosing to bike instead of drive isn't increasing even faster than <a href="https://bostoncyclistsunion.org/if-you-build-it-they-will-bike" target="_blank">it already is</a>.  When you see the lack of interconnectivity between neighborhoods&mdash;especially the lack of north-south connections&mdash;it becomes more apparent how the existing fragments of lines don't quite get people to their destinations.
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="https://zmyaro.com/blog/2025/05/16/imgs/bridge_bike_network.jpg" alt="We're not seeing drivers using the new bridge we built.&rdquo;  A bridge has a hole missing in the middle.  Connected networks are just as important for people on bikes as they are for those driving cars." />
					</figure>
					
					<h2>Destination in sight</h2>
					<p>
						Not only does the landway map help people visualize the network we hope to have someday, but the process of making it&mdash;biking the &ldquo;lines&rdquo; to confirm how they group together&mdash;helped me better understand the needs served by certain routes!  If you notice how westbound Somerville Ave. ends at Porter Square, eastbound Concord Ave. protection ends around Fresh Pond Mall and <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/communitydevelopment/danehyparkconnector" target="_blank">Danehy Park</a>, and the general lack of fully protected routes in between, filling the gap with the <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/communitydevelopment/2020bikeplanupdate" target="_blank">Cambridge Bicycle Plan</a>'s proposed rail trail from Porter to Danehy makes perfect sense.  And certainly, the map makes it immediately apparent how the <a href="https://voice.somervillema.gov/elm-beacon-connector" target="_blank">Elm-Beacon Connector</a> is vital to a route that runs from Teele Square all the way into Boston!
					</p>
					<p>
						It also helped me see the different reasons for different routes.  For instance, <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/streetsandtransportation/projectsandprograms/broadwaysafetyimprovementproject" target="_blank">Broadway in Cambridge</a> or <a href="https://voice.somervillema.gov/springhillsewer/news_feed/lower-summer-street-school-st-to-bow-st-streetscape-work-resumes-thursday-3-24" target="_blank">Summer St. in Somerville</a> are necessary to provide safe connections to schools, places of worship, and parks along them; meanwhile <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/streetsandtransportation/projectsandprograms/cambridgestreetsafetyimprovementproject" target="_blank">Cambridge St. in Cambridge</a> or <a href="https://voice.somervillema.gov/west-broadway-reconstruction" target="_blank">Broadway in Somerville</a> also serve as vital cross-town connections to major squares.  Like a public transit system, the network will function best when it can facilitate those nearby <em>and</em> distant connections.
					</p>
					<p>
						We have a ways to go, but there are ample city and state projects working to fill in the gaps.  If you are passionate about any of them, <strong>reach out to your elected officials and let them know</strong>!
					</p>
					<figure>
						<img src="https://zmyaro.com/blog/2025/05/16/imgs/landway_map_v12_camberville_combined_projects.png" alt="The, Current and Proposed, version of the Camberville Landway map shows various projects around the area that plan to build missing segments of the network." />
						<figcaption>Which connection are you most eager for?</figcaption>
					</figure>
					
					<h2>Next stop: safer streets!</h2>
					<p>
						What will the landway empower you to do?  Scooter to the library with your child?  Skip rush hour traffic and take a Bluebike (or your own bike) to work?  Save on gas and pick up groceries in a CargoB?  Or just connect with your neighbors as part of the street, not sealed off from it?
					</p>
					<p>
						Each missing link brings us further freedom from car traffic.  Just as this map does for Cambridge and Somerville, we'll keep expanding the landway map to show how projects years in the making&mdash;from <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/project/boylston-street-back-bay" target="_blank">the vital Boylston St. connection</a>, to <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/project/western-avenue-better-bike-lanes" target="_blank">the much-needed safety improvements on Western Ave.</a>, to <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/project/blue-hill-avenue-transportation-action-plan" target="_blank">the transformative multimodal improvements for Blue Hill Ave.</a>, to <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation/hyde-park-avenue-multimodal-corridor" target="_blank">the much-delayed, locally popular improvements to Hyde Park Ave.</a>&mdash;will coalesce into a network connecting destinations across Boston!
					</p>
					<p>
						Help us bring this vision to reality&mdash;join <a href="https://BostonCyclistsUnion.org" target="_blank">Boston Cyclists Union</a>, <a href="https://www.CambridgeBikeSafety.org" target="_blank">Cambridge Bicycle Safety</a>, the <a href="https://sass-somerville.org" target="_blank">Somerville Alliance for Safe Streets</a>, <a href="https://SomervilleBikeSafety.org" target="_blank">Somerville Bicycle Safety</a>, and <a href="https://www.massbike.org/bike-advocacy-groups" target="_blank">other local safe street advocacy groups</a>.

			<title>Chrome Falsely Reporting Extensions &ldquo;No Longer Supported&rdquo;</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2025/03/03</link>
			<pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 15:00:00 EST</pubDate>

				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						Google Chrome has started telling people several of my extensions, including <a href="https://zmyaro.com/extensions/voiceactions">Voice Actions for Chrome</a>, are &ldquo;no longer supported&rdquo;.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>This is extremely misleading&mdash;I still support them, and you can still use them!</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						This is Google trying to force extension developers' hands:
					</p>
					<p>
						A more accurate way to put it is Google plans to remove these extensions to force extension developers from &ldquo;manifest version 2&rdquo; to &ldquo;version 3&rdquo;. There are various important reasons developers are staying on MV2, but the important one here is Google isn't adding MV3 support to older Chromebooks, which puts developers like me in a tough situation where we either stay on MV2 as long as possible, or effectively force a lot of people to buy new Chromebooks just to keep using our extensions!
					</p>
					<p>
						Firefox and other browsers are continuing to support MV2 alongside MV3 for the foreseeable future and enable MV3 support on older devices. There is no practical reason Chrome needs to create a situation where people need to buy new Chromebooks just to keep using their favorite extensions!
					</p>
					<p>
						I am going to keep Voice Actions and my other extensions on MV2 and test them on older Chromebooks for as long as Google lets me, and when Chrome tries to disable them, you can go to chrome://extensions and manually reenable them. I hope this explanation helps; thank you for understanding!

			<title>Summarizing My Experience At The MBTA Draw One Bridge Replacement Open House</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2025/01/05</link>
			<pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2025 16:40:00 EST</pubDate>

				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						For those out of the loop, the <abbr title="Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority">MBTA</abbr> is planning to <a href="https://www.mbta.com/projects/north-station-drawbridge-replacement" target="_blank">replace the &ldquo;Draw One&rdquo; bridge over which trains access North Station</a>.  Besides not having the mechanical issues of the existing century-old bridge, Massachusetts legally committed, in the 1990s, to adding a pedestrian/micromobility walkway when the bridge was rebuilt as part of environmental mitigation for the Big Dig.  The MBTA quietly revealed last year that their plan no longer included following through on that commitment.  On Friday, January 3<sup>rd</sup>, the MBTA held an open house about the project at the Cambridge Library Central Square branch.  This is a summary of my experience there:
					</p>
					
					<h2><abbr title="Regarding" style="text-decoration: none;">Re.</abbr> the current state of things</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							There is absolutely no plan right now for building the pedestrian/micromobility connection to North Station as part of this project.
							<ul>
								<li>
									No renderings, no sketches, no rough timeline, not even concepts of a plan.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							The project staff tried to avoid taking responsibility/accountability for most of the decisions related to removing the pedestrian path from the bridge.
							<ul>
								<li>
									They asked why we didn't bug MassDOT or DCR about it when those organizations would have pointed us to the Draw One team because that pedestrian connection has been (officially, as far as the public was told) part of the Draw One project for the past 20-30 years.
								</li>
								<li>
									They tried to frame that pedestrian connection across the river to North Station as a goal or desire rather than a <em>legal contractual commitment</em> the state made.
								</li>
								<li>
									Some of them claimed because they were new to the MBTA, we shouldn't expect them to know the organization's prior commitments.
								</li>
								<li>
									Some of them tried to claim it wasn't their responsibility because &ldquo;the state&rdquo; made the commitment, not them in particular, as though they weren't the folks the state had tasked with carrying out that commitment.
								</li>
								<li>
									Some of them claimed the MBTA only needed to be focused on moving train and buses across the bridge (even though plenty of other MBTA projects focus on how people get _to_ MBTA stations).
								</li>
								<li>
									Basically, if there was anything they all seemed to agree on, it was that we shouldn't be displeased with them for dropping the pedestrian connection from this project after ≈30 years of it being part of the project.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Some of them focused on how having a pedestrian crossing over a drawbridge could be a safety issue (because it would be another way people could get onto the tracks, or because people could fall off when the bridge opens), and a stationary bridge that arcs up and over would be better.  They also said a stationary bridge would be more convenient because the uphill walk would be better than potentially having to wait for the drawbridge to lower.
							<ul>
								<li>
									They had no plan for such an alternative bridge.
								</li>
								<li>
									They had no answer for how a pedestrian connection across this bridge would be worse than the next nearest crossings—the locks and the Museum Of Science bridge—which also open.
								</li>
								<li>
									They had no answer for why people would be more likely to try to get on the tracks around the edge of the fence when the bridge is open vs. much more easily walking onto the tracks from the skate park.
								</li>
								<li>
									Basically, all evidence points to their safety concerns being made-up after the fact to justify cutting the pedestrian connection, not genuine issues that can't be mitigated like they are at every other drawbridge with a sidewalk.
								</li>
								<li>
									They had no concrete answer for whether such an alternative bridge could be made part of this project.
									<ul>
										<li>
											One of them suggested it should be tacked onto DCR's project to build a pedestrian bridge over the North Station tracks, but confirmed DCR that wasn't something DCR had expressed any openness to or intention of doing.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							They claimed the decision to remove the pedestrian crossing was made sometime before last year because the federal grant application team thought cutting it (reducing the cost by about 1%) would make the grant application &ldquo;more competitive&rdquo;
						</li>
						<li>
							As Scott Kilcoyne put it, &ldquo;It really was a long conversation of them throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing if an excuse stuck, but within one probing question of an answer the excuse held up as well as cooked spaghetti.&rdquo;
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2><abbr title="Regarding" style="text-decoration: none;">Re.</abbr> where to things go from here</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							They said the MBTA started talking with other state agencies about the pedestrian connection last September (5 months after they announced dropping it from this project and 3 months after the public meeting, both resulted in several hundred emails and voiced comments telling them to keep their promise).
						</li>
						<li>
							They said they will release a joint statement with DCR, DOT, and the governor's office (IIRC) on Tuesday the 7th, after this public comment phase closes, addressing the issue.
							<ul>
								<li>
									They read us a snippet of the latest draft of the statement, and it <em>completely</em> avoids any of those involved taking responsibility for the pedestrian connection.  It actually changes the dynamic of the past ≈30 years, where the Draw One project has held responsibility for it, to one where <em>no one</em> is formally responsible for it.
								</li>
								<li>
									They seemed genuinely proud of the statement and shocked we unanimously saw through and took issue with that.  We all requested they address that before the final statement on Tuesday.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							One member of the team suggested the rail bridge could be &ldquo;phase 1&rdquo; of the project, and the pedestrian bridge could be &ldquo;phase 2&rdquo;, but was clear that was his idea, not one shared by the whole team, let alone a formal commitment.
							<ul>
								<li>
									They didn't respond to asking whether the latest design, being a new iteration of a design that once had the pedestrian path, could be retrofitted with the path in the hypothetical &ldquo;phase 2&rdquo;, which seemed to suggest they weren't really planning on it.
								</li>
								<li>
									They <em>were</em> happy to go into detail about the 3 phases (or subphases I guess?) of construction the rail bridge would go through to enable trains to cross the river throughout construction.  Just not about this hypothetical 4th phase for the pedestrian connection.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							They didn't respond to asking whether it would be less expensive to build the pedestrian connection as part of the same project (whether connected to the drawbridge or not) vs. a separate project.  It is extremely probable doing it as a separate project, as they seem to want, would be more expensive for the state overall, but they seemed exclusively focused on how it would make the train bridge part less expensive.
							<ul>
								<li>
									They did acknowledge it could be less expensive if the same contractor did the train bridge project for them and the pedestrian bridge project for anyone-but-them, but then they wouldn't respond to why it wouldn't be more cost-effective to make it part of this project.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Someone asked about them setting themselves up to be sued for violating their legal commitment to build that pedestrian connection with this project, as they were when they tried to cut the pedestrian path from the GLX project.  They basically refused to acknowledge the question.
						</li>
						<li>
							This public comment period ends this <strong>Monday, the 6<sup>th</sup></strong>, by noon.  You can <strong>email comments to <a href="mailto:DrawOne@mbta.com" target="_blank">DrawOne@mbta.com</a>!</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
									One person I spoke with said the difference from the previous period is this is part of the federal process, so where public comments from the last one just went to MBTA folks involved with the project, public commenst from this period will go to folks involved in the federal grant, environmental review, and permitting processes.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h2><abbr title="Too long; didn't read" style="text-decoration: none;">TL;DR</abbr></h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							No one at the T thinks their ≈30-year-old promise to build pedestrian access between the parks or to North Station when they rebuilt this bridge is their responsibility anymore.
						</li>
						<li>
							They were blindsided by the massive public backlash to finding out they had dropped that promise and only started reaching out to other state agencies to collaborate late last year.
						</li>
						<li>
							They are aiming to shift responsibility for this promise to a nebulous cloud of DCR + DOT + the governor's office so none of them have to directly take responsibility, BUT:
						</li>
						<li>
							Unlike last year's, this week's meetings and online public comment period are part of the federal review process, so more people will see our comments, and the T will be required by federal law to respond.
							<ul>
								<li>
									&gt;&gt; <strong>Email <a href="mailto:DrawOne@mbta.com" target="_blank">DrawOne@mbta.com</a> by Monday morning!</strong> &lt;&lt;
								</li>
							</ul>

						As with previous years, I know Spotify Wrapped happens at the beginning of December (and stops collecting data earlier), but I wanted to continue doing top songs for the whole year. Once again, there were newly acquired songs and newly revived hyperfixations only at the end of the year.

						Because several songs near the end had equal play counts, I decided to let them tie for #100.

						(<a href="https://zmyaro.com/blog/2024/01/07/imgs/2023_top100.png" target="_blank">Full top 100 list</a>)
					</div>
					<p>
						This year's miscellaneous observations include:
						<ul>
							<li>
								I certainly wasn't surprised to see <i>Tears Of The Kingdom</i> at the top or <i>Spider-Verse</i> and my favorite song from <i>So Much (For) Stardust</i> right behind it.  Those were easily some of my favorite media/events of the year.  Speaking of which...
							</li>
							<li>
								I also wasn't surprised to see my favorite song from the <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i> Booster Course Pass, one of my other favorite works of the year.  Absolute bop.
							</li>
							<li>
								And on that note, one of my favorite <i>Mario Kart</i> songs of all time right behind it since the Booster Course Pass got me solidly back on <i>Mario Kart</i> music in general.
							</li>
							<li>
								I wasn't surprised the brief return of my <i>Portal</i> hyperfixation brought <i>Portal</i> music to my top 100, but I was surprised &ldquo;You Wouldn't Know&rdquo; was the only one to make it, and so high!
							</li>
							<li>
								Most of the <i>Doctor Who</i> music on the list got there in December&mdash;some after the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary specials, but actually a lot only after the Christmas special!  The 1996 movie theme made it all the way to #4 (and &ldquo;The Shepherd's Boy to the top 20) in just the last 5 days of the year!
								<br />
								After <i>Six</i> and <i>Hadestown</i> not doing so well at the end of their years, this might be the most surprising in the top 10&mdash;or even top 20!
							</li>
							<li>
								I wasn't surprised some Sarah &amp; The Safe Word made the list (though I kind of expected more), but I was surprised &ldquo;Ruby Off The Rails&rdquo; wasn't the highest since it was the one that stuck in my head most from the new album.
							</li>
							<li>
								With all the other <i>Mario Kart</i> music, I was surprised the <i>Tour</i> version of &ldquo;Berlin Byways&rdquo; didn't make the list since that was another I listened to a lot.
							</li>
							<li>
								I was surprised &ldquo;Planet Of The Bass&rdquo; ended up so low with how much I listened to it when it came out, but I suppose the joke didn't last very long in hindsight.
							</li>
							<li>
								I wouldn't have expected the <i>Utena</i> theme to break into the top 100 at all, let alone as high as it did.  And if anything from <i>Utena</i> were going to, I would expect &ldquo;Zettai Unmei Mokushiroku&rdquo;.
							</li>
							<li>
								I was surprised &ldquo;The Wolf&rdquo; by Siamés and &ldquo;Coloris&rdquo; by She didn't make the list&mdash;they were a couple songs I got from a friend this year that I particularly enjoyed.
							</li>
							<li>
								I was also surprised by the lack of Porter Robinson because I recall listening to a fair bit.
							</li>
							<li>
								I was also surprised there wasn't any Taylor Swift (not counting mashups) because I listened to quite a bit around Spotify Wrapped time, and obviously <i>Doctor Who</i> proved a sufficiently determined late-year hyperfixation can break into the top 100.
							</li>
							<li>
								I don't know how noteworthy it is which soundtracks and hyperfixations didn't last.  Part of me is a little sad how little <i>Six</i> is on the list.
							</li>
							<li>
								After two years of saying I expected more mashups to rank higher, this year, the mashup spread feels about what I should have expected.
							</li>
							<li>
								There continues to be no good way to fully automate generating alt text for these screenshots, but a script I wrote did a <em>little</em> more of the work for me than last year.
							</li>
						</ul>

			<title>I Fixed Highlighting Text In Trello</title>

					<p>
						A while back, Trello inexplicably decided to make text selection highlights invisible.  I finally got frustrated enough by that to make <a href="https://zmyaro.com/extensions/trellohighlight" target="_blank">a browser extension that fixes it</a>.  This is probably the most basic extension I have ever released, and one that shouldn't have ever been needed, but here we are.

			<title>Experimental Twitter (And Mastodon) &ldquo;Collections&rdquo;</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2023/04/07</link>
			<pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2023 08:15:00 EDT</pubDate>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						In 2015, Google+ added Collections, which let you group your posts by topic.  A collection could be public or limited, and people could choose to follow specific collections from you instead of all or nothing.  I post and reshare posts about a lot of different topics&mdash;just in recent weeks, they included accessibility, the <i>Barbie</i> movie, bail reform, <abbr title="large language models" style="text-decoration: none;">LLMs</abbr>, game dev, mental health care, <i>Mario Kart</i>, Mastodon, <i>Metroid</i>, police accountability, <i>Portal</i>, public transit, SongZ, <i>Star Trek: Picard</i>, <i>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</i>, <i>Tears Of The Kingdom</i>, trans rights, Twitter, and various web development topics.  Obviously Google+ is gone, and none of the big 3 social media platforms has added collections since, but there are still people who are not interested in seeing all of those topics, so I am trying a new experiment.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can now follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ZMYaroFandom" target="_blank">@ZMYaroFandom</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ZMYaroPolitics" target="_blank">@ZMYaroPolitics</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ZMYaroWork" target="_blank">@ZMYaroWork</a> on Twitter (or <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ZMYaroFandom" target="_blank">@ZMYaroFandom</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ZMYaroPolitics" target="_blank">@ZMYaroPolitics</a>, and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@ZMYaroWork" target="_blank">@ZMYaroWork</a> on Mastodon (@mastodon.social)) to get just the posts in those &ldquo;collections&rdquo;.  I will probably never post from those accounts, just RT things from @ZMYaro that are relevant to them, so if you want to keep following my main, you don't need to do anything.  For people who don't know me who came more for police accountability or web development and less for my <i>Metroid</i> and <i>Star Trek</i> ramblings, though, this may be preferable.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is not a perfect system, but I want to try it for a few months, at least, and see how it goes.  With multi-account support in <a href="https://elk.zone" target="_blank">Elk</a>, Twitter for Android, and TweetDeck, I am not too worried about the effort on my end.  My biggest worry is potentially annoying people with double-retweets*.  I would be more concerned about how this might mess with my reach in the Twitter algorithm, but the algorithm has been, shall we say, a bit less reliable lately regardless of my shenanigans.
					</p>
					<p>
						I also want to push myself to keep those 3 accounts authentic facets of myself.  It would be easy, for instance, to keep @ZMYaroWork a sterile, corporate-algorithm-optimized space, but that wouldn't be me, and I don't think many other people who work in the same fields as me would care for it either.  It might lean more serious than @ZMYaroFandom, but it should still have jokes, quips, and unpolished opinions.  Part of why I went through and backfilled each account was to try to find that line for each one.
					</p>
					<p>
						As with all my social media experiments, I appreciate constructive feedback, and I certainly intend to adjust how I handle these &ldquo;collection&rdquo; accounts over the coming days, weeks, and months, where problems arise or I see opportunities to improve.
					</p>
					<aside style="font-size: smaller;">
						(*<em>Huge</em> apology to people I RT a lot who got hit with a ton of notifications when I was setting up these new accounts!!)

						Been a hot minute since I did any sort of API mashup, but I threw together a thing on the side of my home page that pulls in my recent <a href="https://queue.zmyaro.com" target="_blank">queue</a> items from Trello and my most played songs of the past month from <a href="https://zmyaro.com/apps/songz" target="_blank">SongZ</a> 😊

						As with last year, I know Spotify Wrapped happens at the beginning of December (and stops collecting data earlier), but I wanted to get my top played songs for all of 2022&mdash;most notably because there was some new music I only got at the end of the year.

						(<a href="https://zmyaro.com/blog/2023/01/02/imgs/2022_top100.png" target="_blank">Full top 100 list</a>)
					</div>
					<p>
						As always, I enjoy doing this for all the interesting ways it can confirm or disprove my assumptions, and I also found it interesting to compare to last year's to see what has changed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Some miscellaneous observations include:
						<ul>
							<li>
								I am <em>not</em> surprised <i>Tick, Tick...BOOM!</i> did well.  I was initially surprised &ldquo;Come To Your Senses&rdquo; beat out &ldquo;Louder Than Words&rdquo; and &ldquo;30/90&rdquo;, but then I remembered the former is on my playlist for listening to while falling asleep, while the latter is (for obvious reasons) not.
							</li>
							<li>
								The <i>Star Trek: Prodigy</i> theme is my favorite new <i>Star Trek</i> theme since the '90s, but I was still surprised it made it to the top 5!
							</li>
							<li>
								The only reason the <i>Age Of Calamity</i> theme wasn't in my top 100 last year was because I had not added it to my library yet.
							</li>
							<li>
								(Ditto &ldquo;Read My Mind&rdquo; and the <i>Smash Bros.</i> Rainbow Road medley.)
							</li>
							<li>
								I think I expected at least one song from <i>Belle</i> to beat the <i>Mean Girls</i> musical since I remember enjoying the music from the former more (not that I <em>don't</em> enjoy &ldquo;World Burn&rdquo;).
							</li>
							<li>
								I am <em>not</em> surprised the Protomen cover of &ldquo;I Still Believe&rdquo; ranked highly.  I have no idea why I did not listen to <i>The Cover Up</i> much before this year despite having it in my library, but it is really good, and that was easily my favorite track from it this year.
							</li>
							<li>
								I am also not surprised <i>Splatoon</i> had some good representation with <i>Splatoon 3</i> releasing this year, and it will likely get a bit of a boost in the coming year if we get an official <i>Splatune 3</i>.  I <em>was</em> surprised &ldquo;Fresh Start&rdquo; made not only the top 100, but the top 50, beating out even &ldquo;Calamari Inkantation&rdquo;!
							</li>
							<li>
								I was not surprised my top 10 last year were not the same as my top 10 this year&mdash;I knew I listened to them less than I did in 2021&mdash;but I was surprised by how far some fell.  I was not surprised to see &ldquo;Paralyzed&rdquo; bumped down a little (I like it, but I was surprised it made #1), but I was very surprised &ldquo;Keep Coming Back To The Start&rdquo; did not make the top 100 at all this year, and a bit surprised to see neither did &ldquo;White Rabbit&rdquo; or &ldquo;White Woman's Instagram&rdquo;.  And just as shocking, &ldquo;Inferno&rdquo; somehow dropped from #5 to barely hanging on at #100!
							</li>
							<li>
								I also expected Sarah &amp; The Safe Word to fare better since I did not think I listened to them significantly less than 2021.  In particular, &ldquo;The Louisville Shuffle&rdquo; did not make the top 100 at all despite making it to #15 last year.
							</li>
							<li>
								Possibly the top reason I wanted to do a full year Wrapped instead of just through December 1<sup>st</sup> was I saw <i>Six</i> in December and got <em>very</em> into the soundtracks (UK Studio Recording <em>and</em> Live Broadway Recording).  I was curious whether any of them made the top 100 in that time, but only &ldquo;Don't Lose Ur Head&rdquo; did.
								<ul>
									<li>
										Incidentally, I checked my top 100 for just December, and <i>Six</i> held all of the top 9, and 16 of the top 20!
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
								No matter when you cut it off, though, some album is going to get the short end of the stick.  <i>Hadestown</i> did not fare <em>too</em> poorly last year, but it probably would have done better if I had not seen it in November, splitting its peak listens between the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022.  By contrast, while I <em>did</em> listen to <i>Tick, Tick...BOOM!</i> more overall, it also benefited from its peak listens being in January.
							</li>
							<li>
								Once again, I expected more mashups to rank higher.
							</li>
							<li>
								There continues to be no good way to automate generating alt text for these screenshots.
							</li>
						</ul>

						I have been working on this on and off for a while, and though it is certainly not done, I am excited to share my progress before I step away from it again. I (uncreatively) called the project Ideal UX, and it is my ideal cross-form-factor desktop environment. I hope to finish refining the unfinished parts and building the interactive version someday, but in the meantime, if you are so inclined, please check out the current iteration at <a href="https://idealux.zmyaro.com" target="_blank">idealux.zmyaro.com</a>.

			<title>“Biological Sex” Is Like Cookies</title>

					<p>
						As I sometimes do, I made the mistake of wading into an online argument about gender, someone tried to use the stale argument that saying you believe 2 + 2 = 5 does not make it true, and that made me want a new analogy.  Biology is not governed by simple mathematical rules like addition of integers is, but it does involve a lot of chemistry, so if I may, allow me to bring in another application of chemistry: baking.
					</p>
					<p>
						Imagine your whole life, you have only had standard supermarket sugar cookies and chocolate chip cookies.  Someone could put chocolate chips in a sugar cookie recipe, but you would probably argue that does not make it a chocolate chip cookie.  You might say a &ldquo;real&rdquo; chocolate chip cookie, has a different flavor and texture&mdash;but does that make it wrong to put chocolate chips in a sugar cookie recipe?  At the end of the day, that difference is a different balance of brown and white sugar, maybe a little more egg and vanilla.  Change the ingredients further, and you end up with chocolate chip scones&mdash;or pancakes!  If you let yourself dive into it, you can realize what we think of as the ideal sugar cookie and chocolate chip cookie are just the arrangements we are most accustomed to of ingredients that can be tweaked in all manner of major or minor ways.  And while there is certainly nothing wrong with preferring a Nestlé Toll House traditional one, is it really your place to be telling other people how to make <em>their</em> cookies?
					</p>
					<p>
						Someone once suggested I try adding a packet of vanilla pudding mix to chocolate chip cookie batter, and even though that packet was assigned pudding at birth, it made a pretty good batch of cookies 🤷

			<title>Re. Conservative Voters And The Recent SCOTUS Decisions</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2022/06/27</link>

				<![CDATA[
					<aside style="text-align: left; font-style: italic;">
						(I originally wrote this for Facebook, since that is where the most conservative people I know are, but it is easy enough to x-post elsewhere.)
					</aside>
					<p>
						Since some folks missed some of these, reiterating that the Supreme Court just said:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Police <em>cannot</em> be sued for failing to read you your rights.</li>
						<li>States are required to fund private religious schools.</li>
						<li>Public school employees may lead students in prayer during school events.</li>
						<li>States <em>cannot</em> require people to show “proper cause” to get a concealed carry gun permit.</li>
						<li>States may ban abortion.</li>
						<li>They should reconsider the rulings that currently protect contraception, same-sex sex, and same-sex marriage.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						All of this is consistent with what the Republican party on the whole has supported for years (Donald Trump explicitly said while campaigning he would nominate anti-abortion, pro-gun Supreme Court Justices, for instance), so yes, if you supported politicians with these positions, you supported this happening.
					</p>
					<p>
						I do recognize politics are imperfect, and sometimes you get stuck supporting a candidate with some positions you support and some you do not (see: me voting for Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton in the 2020 and 2016 general elections).  You still need to own that you decided xe was the best option despite xer worst positions.
					</p>
					<p>
						And to be clear, if you have exercised those rights yourself but still supported those politicians, you still supported this happening.  Me having sex with a same-sex significant other would not somehow make it OK to support denying that right to others.  Me marrying a same-sex SO would not somehow make it OK to support denying that right to others.  My SO (or me, when it is finally available) using contraception would not somehow make it OK to support denying that right to others.  My SO having an abortion would not somehow make it OK to support denying that right to others.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you <em>did</em> support politicians who promised these things, but you have since had a change of heart, I am glad you changed your mind, but it is on <em>you</em> to let people know what you now believe if you want them to treat you differently based on that, and more importantly, it is on you to undo the harm you have supported in the past.
					</p>
					<p>
						For myself, I try to keep a consistent set of personal values, and I am certainly open to having it pointed out (in good faith) where a contradiction needs to be reconciled, or where I am falling short.  For the Facebook audience this was originally written for, my political views have been in my profile for quite some time, so hopefully none of this comes as a shock.

			<title>The Ethics Of The Jurati Collective</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2022-05-06</link>

				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						(⚠️ <i>Star Trek: Picard</i> S2 spoilers)
					</p>
					<p>
						Once again, a season of <i>Star Trek: Picard</i> introduces an interesting concept with moral questions and gives me no faith it will be properly discussed or acknowledged going forward.
					</p>
					<p>
						Jurati's proposal was to build a new Collective out of people in distress who have no one else to save them.  The show seems to treat that as good...but really only because it is more voluntary than the forced assimilation by the Borg up to that point.
					</p>
					<p>
						But how voluntary is a choice you make when it is the only one available to you?  Jurati's proposal did not sound like dispensing the &ldquo;no strings attached&rdquo; help the Federation provides, where they will fix your geomagnetic compensators, drop you some dilithium, and leave you be until/unless you later approach them after deciding you want to be a part of what they do&mdash;and can leave again if you feel it no longer acts in your best interests.  It sounds like a cult some would join in a moment of desperation when they have no one else to turn to and then not feel they could ever leave&mdash;joining the Collective is not easily or entirely reversible, and on top of that, most of the known galaxy being prejudiced against xBs only increases the chances they would run back to the support network they have: the Collective.
					</p>
					<p>
						Obviously I expect none of those moral questions to be addressed in S3 any more than S2 addressed the S1 finale, where the writers took a man who had multiple traumatic experiences that involved replacing parts of himself with cybernetic components, transferred his consciousness into a synthetic body, and then decided there were no moral or psychological issues to explore with that and they could basically act as though it never happened.

					</div>
					<p>
						The most surprising thing to me this year was &ldquo;Paralyzed&rdquo; taking #1 by a decent margin&mdash;I know I was really into it for a bit, but I did not realize by how much.  #2 was less surprising, with Abigail Thorn making it my &ldquo;good vibes&rdquo; song of the year since introducing me to it at the end of January.  #3 and the general presence of Inside in the top 10 is also not so surprising.  &ldquo;White Rabbit&rdquo; making the top 100 is not surprising, but with <i>The Matrix: Resurrections</i> so late in the year, I am surprised it made it to #4!
					</p>
					<p>
						Other miscellaneous observations include:
						<ul>
							<li>I think I expected more mashups to make the top 100.</li>
							<li>If you know the names of the opening and credits songs, you can guess I watched <i>The Tatami Galaxy</i> this year.</li>
							<li>I did also rewatch <i>Promare</i> this year, but &ldquo;Inferno&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kakusei&rdquo; would have made the top 25 regardless.</li>
							<li>&ldquo;Montero&rdquo; would absolutely have ranked higher if the playthroughs from March 2021 had not been lost.</li>
							<li>There is no good way to automate generating alt text for these screenshots.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						(*A lot of data from October 2020-August 2021 did not make it to the final database, but this is as complete a top 100 as I can get.)

				<![CDATA[
					<h2>
						The good:
					</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I appreciated they kept it in New York instead of spending time sight-seeing.  Joining the Avengers for stuff was cool and all, but I want more friendly neighborhood Spider-Man content to balance out the cosmic and multiverse stuff, like the Maguire movies, but also like what I remember from the animated series years ago.
						</li>
						<li>
							I really liked the characterizations of the returning characters&mdash;the ones that were tweaked were still close enough to feel in character.
						</li>
						<li>
							On a related note, I think this film did a better job balancing its big cast than <i>Spider-Man 3</i> or <i>Eternals</i>, so kudos to the writers for that.  Though I recognize they had the advantage of not having to really introduce any of them.
						</li>
						<li>
							Also on a related note: DOC OCK!!!  Sorry, he just continues to be my favorite <i>Spider-Man</i> villain.  (Maybe this movie will get me to actually cosplay him(?))
						</li>
						<li>
							They had decent excuses for sidelining Dr. Strange from the fights&mdash;no need to send him to the magical pool with the script for <i>Thor: Ragnarok</i>¡
						</li>
						<li>
							The three Peters together were great, and I appreciate that there were good character interactions beyond the obligatory fanservice.
						</li>
						<li>
							I <em>really</em> liked Maguire!Peter&mdash;I have been disappointed since Holland was cast in <i>Civil War</i> that we did not get a live action adult Peter (as great as Holland is in the role), and I really like that we got to see him having learned from his mistakes, owned them, and grown into a better person.
							<ul>
								<li>
									(Maybe the bar has just been set so low that one of the most attractive things a man can be is emotionally mature 😛)
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							Garfield!Peter saving MJ...I saw that moment coming, I knew it was going to be an obligatory callback to a kind of poorly handled moment...and even so, it got me in the feels so much harder than I expected 🥺
						</li>
						<li>
							Seeing it in Boston was fun because the whole theater got a kick out of, &ldquo;They have crime in Boston, right?&rdquo;
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>
						Complaints:
					</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							It may have technically been set in New York, but it still largely felt like generic city.  <em>Especially</em> compared to the Raimi Trilogy, but even compared to <i>Amazing</i>.
						</li>
						<li>
							I realized after the movie Zendaya!MJ is like the least developed of the live action Spider-Man primary love interests.  Dunst!MJ was an actual person with her own interests and desires outside her relationship with Peter; Zendaya!MJ's traits are...she is angsty and allegedly knowledgeable about some STEM field even though we barely see her use that(?)
						</li>
						<li>
							I just also cared much less about their relationship in this one(?)  They are cute and all together, but because she feels less fleshed out, it makes their relationship feel more hollow(?)  Like Garfield!Peter and Stone!Gwen's interactions were really cringey in <i>Amazing 2</i>, but at least that was a little bit because you could see she had goals outside her relationship with Peter and he was being inconsiderate (to say the least) of that.
							<ul>
								<li>
									(Not saying it was definitely because of th^t, but my theater applauded for every old character's return, every Spider-team moment, every great line, and was <em>silent</em> during Holland!Peter and Zendaya!MJ's big kiss moment.)
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							I assumed we just skipped Peter's origin story in the MCU because it was the same as the last two we saw, but the first scene with all the Peters seemed to imply Holland!Peter did <em>not</em> have his own Uncle Ben moment, and I dislike that.
						</li>
						<li>
							Related, killing Tomei!May felt kind of like an unearned fridging.  I think there is the potential for a message about it being important to try to rehabilitate people despite what the Goblin did to May becoming an important value to Holland!Peter going forward, but I am going to judge the choice to kill her harshly for now and only reevaluate if we see that shift in his character in future movies.
							<ul>
								<li>
								(But hey, Uncle Ben Moment 2! [Peggle2.gif])
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							I really disliked that the &ldquo;solution&rdquo; for most of the villains was just to remove their powers.  None of the Spider-Men would consider giving up their powers for a second; since when is the problem with Electro or Sandman that they have superpowers??
						</li>
						<li>
							With all the cameos and fanservice, there was one I really wanted: At the moment when the universe was cracking and others were coming through, just give me five seconds of Emma Stone!Spider-Gwen.
							<ul>
								<li>
									(Or Bryce Dallas Howard, but I figure Stone makes more sense since her Gwen was the most developed, just like we obviously got Ifans as Connors instead of Baker.)
								</li>
							</ul>
						<li>
							Other missed cameo opportunity I cared about: At the end, when Peter moves into his new apartment and the landlord tells him when rent is due, they should have brought back the &ldquo;Reeeeent!&rdquo; landlord from the Raimi movies 😛
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<strong>One last thing:</strong> My flatmate wants a <i>Space-Jam</i>-esque crossover with the live action Spider-Men and <i>Into The Spider-Verse</i> Spider-People (and I would like to add 2D animated Spider-Man).  Sony, please make that happen.
					</p>

			<title>Another Metroid Fan's Rant About Samus Returns</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2021-10-03</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						Just to be upfront: I borrowed my friend's copy of <i>Samus Returns</i> after finishing <i>Zero Mission</i>, <i>AM2R</i> (fan <i>Metroid 2</i> remake), <i>Super</i>, and <i>Fusion</i> because it seemed more enjoyable than playing the original <i>Metroid 2</i> or taking another crack at Other M.  I was not going out of my way to try to enjoy it.  I <em>did</em> approach playing it like every other 2D Metroid game, and I 100%'d it to ensure I did not miss any part.  I am also not judging it on difficulty.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						To get it out of the way first, <i>SR</i> is not a good remake of <i>M2</i>.  <i>Zero</i> was a good enough remake that my memories of <i>M1</i> made it effortless for me to know where I was and where to go.  <i>AM2R</i> did the same with <i>M2</i> (though I should confess I have only watched someone else play the original).  In <i>SR</i>, I think when I reached what <i>AM2R</i> called The Tower was the first time since the first area I had a solid sense I knew where I was—and even then, it was because of the combination of the power-ups in the area and the long vertical space around the tower of smaller rooms.  After that, I at least knew what would come next, but that was hardly the same as actually recognizing where I was when I was there (the only real hints were the vaguely circular route and the pattern of metroid → <del>lava</del> <ins style="text-decoration: none;">acid(?)</ins> rises → omega reveal → acid lowers.
					</p>
					<p>
						And while <i>AM2R</i> and <i>SR</i> both suffer from being beholden to <i>M2</i>'s structure of making you fight the same bosses over and over, I thought <i>AM2R</i> did an OK job updating the metroids' abilities while staying faithful, and making them appropriately challenging without becoming too tedious (apart from the ones that could knock you out of the room and force you to restart the fight...).  <i>SR</i>, on the other hand, made the metroids' attack patterns feel even more game-y and had the brilliant idea to make several gamma metroids run away, so not only did you have the tedium of fighting many gamma metroids, you had to fight many of them multiple times!
					</p>
					<p>
						And of course, it completely drops the ball on the narrative of <i>M2</i>, with its weirdly acrobatic glory kills for an otherwise weighty Samus, making the baby into just another power-up to help you clear a new type of block so you can get more power-ups, and a shoehorned-in fanservicey Ridley fight at the end (and, of course, neglecting to list the power grip as one of Samus's abilities).
					</p>
					<p>
						Oh, credit where it is due though: <i>SR</i> gets solid points for faithfully remaking the old <i>M2</i> cavern background noises, where <i>AM2R</i> gave up and just added its own <i>Prime</i>-esque music.  On the other hand, <i>AM2R</i> has the better arrangements of <i>M2</i>'s actual music tracks, not to mention the parts where <i>SR</i> just doesn't try and pulls music straight from <i>Super</i>/<i>Prime</i>...
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						But let's pretend I know nothing about <i>M2</i>.  <i>SR</i> still feels more like a fan project than <i>AM2R</i>!  It has some good puzzles and some solid platforming, but it kind of failed to feel like a cohesive Metroid game to me.  <i>Zero</i>, <i>AM2R</i>, and <i>Super</i> had interconnected distinct-looking areas, but the areas in <i>SR</i> felt incredibly samey apart from the lab areas near the end—and even those still had the same enemy types I had been fighting for hours.  <i>AM2R</i> tried to flesh out each area to have memorable visuals and landmarks relating to its purpose in Chozo civilization; <i>SR</i> removed most distinctive landmarks and patterns it could have pulled from <i>M2</i>, and while its backgrounds were gorgeous, most were hardly distinctive or memorable.
					</p>
					<p>
						To put it another way, <i>AM2R</i> starts you exploring the remains of a civilization that happens to also work well as a set of metroidvania areas; <i>SR</i> feels like someone made a planet-sized puzzle box just for you.  <i>AM2R</i> (in ways reminiscent of <i>Zero</i>) has faster ways to navigate rooms if you use your abilities cleverly, facilitating backtracking, speedrunning, and sequence-breaking; <i>SR</i> redesigns rooms by...filling them with new morph ball tunnels and asking you to solve the puzzle(?) of going back and forth between the left and right sides until you have pulled all the grapple beam blocks.  And when <i>AM2R</i> makes me go through morph ball tunnels, it is flavored as going through pipes, cave-ins, and the like, and usually makes traversal quick once you figure out what you need to do; <i>SR</i> offers no flavor and half the time feels like it is padding playtime with busy work.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>AM2R</i> has different enemies in different areas and different depths, and areas where the enemies appear a different densities (including ones devoid of enemies entirely) that yes, contribute to world-building, but also are used to build tension or provide moments of relief.  <i>SR</i>, as mentioned, largely has the same enemy types appearing from start to end, but also has them in fairly consistent density.
					</p>
					<p>
						I think all the above points kind of came together for me in the final halls before the metroid queen—I only recognized them because I thought some patterns of shafts seemed vaguely familiar, and then realized it was about the right place on the map.  Where <i>M2</i> and <i>AM2R</i> had an eerie break in the action in an area that, in flavor, metroids had wiped out all other life from, and in function, built suspense before the final battle...<i>SR</i> turned it into yet another cave with more of the same enemies, and you could be forgiven for mistaking a screenshot from there for any other part of the game.
					</p>
					<p>
						And finally, there were the sprinkling of other ways <i>SR</i> felt as though it was getting in my way and wasting my time.  Where <i>AM2R</i> tried to preserve flow and momentum as well as or better than <i>Fusion</i> and <i>Zero</i>, <i>SR</i> made enemies charge you to encourage use of the momentum-killing melee counter.  Where <i>AM2R</i> let you get around the map as fast as you could use your increasing array of abilities, <i>SR</i> added elevators with slow activation times, confirmation dialogs, and animations.  Where <i>AM2R</i> decided to roll energy and missile refills into save stations, <i>SR</i> added tedious activation times, confirmation dialogs, and animations to them as well (even though the new Aeion refills were old-style quick pick-ups) that made me opt for grinding enemies and risking skipping save points.  Where <i>AM2R</i> followed the example of the <i>Prime</i> games and gave players optional scan logs to explain things and letting them discover the rest through trial and error, <i>SR</i> insisted on grabbing control several times during the initial descent to make sure I absolutely stopped to consider the existence of the big glowing teleport station, or the massive, incredibly conspicuous DNA lock, or the molting metroid right in front of me.  Even dropping in on the metroid queen at the end was interrupted by a cutscene, as though they thought I might miss she was threatening and taking up half the screen!
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						To end this on a positive note, it does, at least, appear the team at MercurySteam has learned from the criticisms of <i>SR</i>.  Where <i>SR</i> had a lot of things that would break up flow, Dread additions to Samus's base moveset specifically maintain flow.  Where <i>SR</i> had few opportunities for sequence-breaking (and almost softlocked me once for bomb-jumping into an area meant to be accessed with the spider ball), Dread's developers have said they intentionally left sequence-breaking opportunities open.  Where the phase drift had few uses beyond running across disintegrating ground and dodging fast projectiles, Dread appears to be bringing back the speed booster with all its speedrunning possibilities.  So in a way, I am kind of glad the team had the opportunity to make its mistakes with a game that also has a much better remake available.  Unfortunate they had to make those mistakes in an official, Nintendo-published Metroid game, but there is reason for optimism.
					</p>
					<p>
						And to un-put-aside <i>SR</i> as a remake of <i>M2</i>, a lot of my complaints there will likely be resolved or moot in Dread.  It is post-<i>Fusion</i>, so the cutscene acrobatics and the like seem a little less out-of-place than they did on a suit so heavy it needed a power grip to pull itself up ledges.  It is not a remake, so there are no themes to undermine or retcons (hopefully) to debate.  It is not remaking a game that focused on environmental storytelling, so it can be more thoughtfully designed around having story-heavy cutscenes rather than its grabbing the camera feeling like an unnecessary interruption.  And while the Ridley fight in <i>SR</i> felt painfully shoehorned in, it <em>was</em> an excellent take on a classic Metroid boss, and that game design sense applied to non-shoehorned-in bosses could be outstanding!
					</p>
					<p>
						Either way, less than a week until I find out.  See you next mission!

			<title>20 Years After 9-11: The Suffering Competition Continues</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2021-09-11</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p style="font-style: italic;">
						I was going to write something new about the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of 9-11, but what I wrote 5 years ago, slightly sensationalist though it may have been, still feels more worth restating than joining the 80 other people this week just writing about the U.S. war in Afghanistan.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						The <del>15</del><ins>20</ins><sup>th</sup> anniversary of the 2001-9-11 terrorist attacks just passed, and with it came a wide variety of online opinions.  I do not want to talk about 9-11&mdash;thousands have already said everything I would have to say.  Instead, I want to address the variety of comments I have seen regarding the attacks of <del>15</del><ins>20</ins> years ago.
					</p>
					<p>
						First, and most importantly, <strong>suffering is not a competition</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Everyone who was injured or killed in the plane crashes or in or around the World Trade Center and Pentagon obviously suffered.  Their friends and families suffered.  Nothing can undo what they endured and continue to endure.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, people across the country and even around the world were profoundly affected by the attacks and what they were intended to symbolize.  Obviously that cannot compare to losing a loved one, but <strong>that does not mean it is not valid or should be ignored</strong>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Furthermore, to this day, scores of innocent Muslims are attacked or murdered every year because they look like the people who attacked us on 9-11.  Even non-Muslims who happen to have head coverings, darker skin, or even just beards, are often attacked for looking too similar to the people who attacked us.  Is that suffering inherently more important than the suffering of the people killed in the 9-11 attacks or their families and friends?  Not necessarily, but that does not mean it is less valid&mdash;or should be ignored.  No number of dead Muslims is going to undo their suffering.  It is just going to cause more suffering, it helps terrorists spread the line that America hates Muslims.  <strong>Attacking people for being different in some way is supposed to be their MO, not ours.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, since the 9-11 attacks, we have started wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and we successfully captured or killed Osama bin Laden and several other &ldquo;high-value targets&rdquo;.  Personally, I would consider that a good thing.  But I can approve of stopping the people behind the 9-11 attacks while still recognizing the innocent civilians who suffered because they happened to be born in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Preventing terrorist leaders launching future attacks is good, but it is also important to remember that civilian casualties and refugees are a part of war, and when we enter into a new war, we know innocent families are going to be torn apart.  The argument is not that their suffering is <em>more</em> important than the suffering of the people killed in the 9-11 attacks or their families and friends, but that it should be <em>no less</em> valid, let alone ignored.  As anyone affected by the 9-11 attacks can tell you, few things are more terrifying than having your life turned upside-down by a surprise attack from a power an ocean away.
					</p>
					<p>
						My point is not that we should forget the attacks of 2001-9-11, or that we should stop opposing terrorism.  My point is we need to stop arguing about who is suffering more and who needs to pay for it, as though that can accomplish anything.  We need to be better than the terrorists who wanted to ignite waves of fear and hate.
					</p>
					<p>
						Because when I remember 9-11, I remember those dead men are still winning.﻿﻿

			<title>A Breakdown Of Why I Think Android 12's Notification Panel Redesign Is Bad And Am Pretty Sure That Is Not Just A Knee-Jerk Response To Change</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2021-06-11</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						I want to prefix this by saying I think Android has consistently stayed ahead of every other major OS in notification handling at least since I got my first Android 2.0 device, and while I was very hesitant when it was first revealed, Material Design grew to become my favorite major design language.  So I am not an Android hater, I am aware of the difference between a knee-jerk negative response to change and considered criticism, and I have tried to both spend enough time with the Android 12 beta and previous versions to ensure this is the latter.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having said all that, TL;DR: I think the changes to notifications and quick settings in Android 12 beta 2 are the worst regression in UX that core part of the Android experience has ever received.
					</p>
					<p>
						I went back to compare to Android 5, 7, and 8, each of which made noteworthy changes to the notification and quick settings panels within the Material Design language.
					</p>
					<p>
						Android 5 (L) made the greatest use of depth&mdash;shadows under the notification cards put them above the current app, and a shadow on the top bar indicated the quick settings panel lay under it, on the same level as the notifications.  It was not very good at communicating to a less tech-savvy user which elements could be tapped or swiped&mdash;a complaint I had at the time when 5 was the first to remove the handle at the bottom of the panel&mdash;but it did, at least, communicate how the different pieces related to each other.
					</p>

						</a>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Android 7 (N) put the notification cards back on a single panel, but shadows still indicated that panel was above the current app, and the top bar was above it.  Since the top bar now stretched to become the quick settings panel, an arrow button was added in case the user did not realize it could be dragged down.  It still did not include the Android 1-4 (A-K) drag handle.  Android 8 (O) did one better, though, having the status bar become the drag handle, making it arguably the most intuitive design it had to date.
					</p>

						</a>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Android 9-11 (P-R) brought one more major UI redesign.  Quick settings lost its arrow button in favor of a drag handle&mdash;an affordance that had by then been standardized across much of Android and iOS design.  Additionally, notifications were somewhere between their Android 5 and 7 designs&mdash;being grouped into a few floating panels.  The overall UX was still roughly the same, with the status bar still becoming the drag handle, and the quick settings panel being visually on the same surface as notifications.
					</p>
					<p>
						That brings me to the beta for Android 12 (S).  I am trying to figure out how to describe what is happening here in terms of Material's metaphors and choreography, and I am basically grasping at straws.  When you drag down from the status bar, the current app...becomes(?) the notification panel?  There are no shadows indicating depth, and the rounded corners suggest the notification panel is probably(?) on top(?) of quick settings(?)  So the current app, which may have layered panels, is itself one surface...which becomes the notification panel...and then moves down to reveal the notification panel(??)
					</p>
					<figure>

						</a>
					</figure>
					<p>
						I was not even sure how best to summarize the Android 12 animation for screenshot alt text.  Just to compare:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Notification cards in Android 5 and 6 stack when opening or closing notifications.</li>
						<li>The notification bar in Android 7 and 8 becomes the drag handle as it opens or closes the notification panel, and icons jump from it into notification cards.</li>
						<li>The notification bar in Android 12 beta 2 opens by fading from the open app to the notification panel as notifications individually expand inside it and the entire screen crops to reveal the top bar with collapsed quick settings.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						But also, to a less familiar, casual user (who does not care about the “choreography” of UI animations), the new design still lacks any indication of which parts are draggable.  If you look at how the stack of notifications moves, you can see they still sometimes follow a (now invisible) drag handle, but the entire screen shifting down to reveal the top of the quick settings panel is now the most attention-grabbing animation, and it feels only loosely connected to the position of the user's finger.  There is similarly no drag handle on quick settings&mdash;or any other indication to an unfamiliar user that it can expand.  And the expanded quick settings panel now pushes the entire rest of the UI off the screen, making it much less clear that quick settings is a subsection of the notification panels, but full-screen sub-views opened from it (like the new shortcuts to GPay and Home Controls) are not.
					</p>
					<p>
						I would be genuinely interested in hearing the Google designers behind these animation and UX changes explain their reasoning&mdash;they won me over with their explanations of changes from Holo to Material and the retirement of the original Material text fields (R.I.P. &#x2764;), but this does not just feel subjectively jarring&mdash;it feels like a regression that is always going to feel a little bit weird because of the lack of clear choreography in the animations, and worse, be much more difficult to teach to the various less tech-savvy folks I do tech support for.

			<title>Outdated Triangle Tutorial Finally Updated</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2021-06-07</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						The most-searched page on this site is still the old tutorial for inserting a triangle symbol in Microsoft Word, which has been outdated for years, so that one, specifically, has received <a href="https://zmyaro.com/comp/math/unicode_triangle" target="_blank">an update</a>.  This does not mark the return of me writing math-on-computer tutorials, but I hope all the folks searching for help using triangle characters in Word find it helpful!

			<title>Android 12 Impressions So Far</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2021-05-25</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						Having had a few days of both watching videos of the planned Android 12 experience and playing with what is available in the beta on my Pixel (3a) today, here are my impressions so far:
					</p>
					<h2>Pros</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Extra dim is finally available by default!</li>
						<li>Moving the notification snooze button to the notification does take up space, but I like that it avoids the half-swipe that could accidentally register as a full swipe.</li>
						<li>I was not a fan of the stretch overscroll effect, but it has grown on me as I have used it more.  I am not the biggest fan of elastic overscroll effects in general, but this one might be my favorite.</li>
						<li>I like having cards and home controls in the power button menu, so I appreciate that you can switch it back to that instead of the Google Assistant.</li>
						<li>I appreciate the new style of toasts for apps saving files or copying to the clipboard.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Unsure</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>I am still mixed on the sparkles in touch ripples.  I liked them at first, but have started to find them a little annoyingly distracting.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Cons</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Notifications have so much padding you can usually only see around 3 notifications when you pull down the notification panel, and an un-expanded heads up notification that pops in while you are using another app has so little room for text it is almost useless.  I imagine it is even worse on a phone under 5".  I think some people might prefer this, but I wish they had a more compact density option as well.  (App icons in bubbles/boxes worked in Android 3-6 because that space was used for any image associated with the notification, would replace it, but now that image appears separately from the app icon and the expansion arrow, and that, combined with the padding for the rounder corners, leaves little room for notification content.)</li>
						<li>Notification icons no longer appear to move smoothly from the notification bar, to the bottom of the notification panel, to their respective notification cards.  I am unsure how final this behavior is though.</li>
						<li>The notification panel no longer shows the date when you open it (you have to open quick settings too).</li>
						<li>Only 4 quick settings are available while collapsed (down from 6).  This alone might convince me to switch back to custom ROMs if they do not revert it by the final release.</li>
						<li>Touch ripples seem to come from the centers of surfaces now, rather than from where I touch.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						There are also some other issues that I am pretty sure are bugs they are already working on, rather than part of their intended experience, so I am not mentioning those here.

			<title>MaterialZ v2.y</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2021-05-04</link>

					<p>
						The next version of <a href="https://zmyaro.com/misc/materialz" target="_blank">MaterialZ</a> is now rolling out: Version&mdash;um...OK, so version numbers in the last few MaterialZ updates have been a little bit...undefined.  Solution: I dub the now-previous version &ldquo;2.x&rdquo;, and that makes this new release <strong>MaterialZ v2.y</strong>!  And it has been packed with exciting things (well, exciting if you like plug-and-play Material Design CSS libraries), ranging from support for some newer browser features (like <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code>), to long-wanted features (like toggle switches and checkbox ripples), to the occasional overdue fix for an older browser (shout-out to anyone else still keeping an Android 2.x device alive).
					</p>
					<p>
						Even with all that, though, it maintains the original goal of MaterialZ: Drop it into an unstyled page for instant Material-ization&mdash;it &ldquo;just works&rdquo;.  And to be sure the new features work as expected in real use cases (and to flex a little on the number of Google apps that still do not use Google's official Material Web Components library), I pretty much updated

			<title>Some Smaller App Improvements (And A Shout-Out To A Friend)</title>

			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						One small thing not really worthy of its own post, but you may have noticed <a href="https://zmyaro.com/extensions/discordtouch">Touch-Friendliness for Discord</a> was broken by the last Discord redesign.  The good news is that redesign addressed several issues the extension was initially created to fix, so there are fewer places the extension needs to step in, which is always kind of the hope with accessibility extensions.  The newer good news is an update is rolling out that makes the extension compatible with the current version of Discord, so everything their redesign did <em>not</em> address is touch-friendly again.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unrelated to that, I have mentioned this before on my social media, but <a href="https://okay.wasv.me" target="_blank">Okay</a> by Billie Stevens is a great lightweight app to have to deal with high stress, panic attacks, or the like.  I submitted a small update to it last week so you can now install it to your home screen and use it offline.

						Over the past few years, I have experimented with a few ways for people to &ldquo;buy me a coffee&rdquo; to support my free apps.  This year, I am trying out Patreon.  I totally recognize a lot of folks are not in a position to donate to open-source software right now, but the start of a new year seemed like a good time to flip the switch.
					</p>
					<p>
						As with past experiments, this is not a paywall. At a future point, when things feel a little less up in the air, I might try more of its features beyond giving folks a way to help cover the costs of developing and hosting these apps, but everything available now and all the core features I was already planning to add to PaintZ, Voice Actions, MaterialZ, Magnethands, etc. will remain free forever.

						<a href="https://zmyaro.com/apps/rewindtheater">Rewind Theater</a> is a simple app based on the old IGN series of the same name, in which they scrubbed through trailers and highlighted details likely to be missed on a first viewing.  I threw the initial app together in under 48 hours before an event where we did a live analysis of the <i>Doctor Who</i> 50th anniversary trailers in 2013, but this month, I rolled out a variety of features and improvements that did not make it in by that deadline, including a nicer toolbar, new controls, better video loading times, offline functionality, and more.  <a href="https://rewindtheater.zmyaro.com" target="_blank">https://rewindtheater.zmyaro.com</a>

			<title>My Eyes! (Light Theme)</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2021-01-15</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						If you have heard me talk about web dev in the past couple years, one thing you might have heard me be very excited about is the <a href="https://web.dev/prefers-color-scheme" target="_blank"><code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media query</a>, which lets your site automatically follow the user's system (or browser) dark/light theme setting.  You might have also heard me complain about how few big-name apps support it (Google, please stop killing my eyes at night with your bright white everywhere).  But not to be a pot calling their kettle...not black...I have also been adding <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> detection to some of my apps, including <a href="https://zmyaro.com/apps/paintz">PaintZ</a>, <a href="https://zmyaro.com/extensions/voiceactions">Voice Actions for Chrome</a>, <a href="https://zmyaro.com/games/magnethands">Dr. Magnethands</a>, and I even added it to the deprecated <a href="https://zmyaro.com/misc/holo">Holo Web site</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, there is a flipside: while dark themes are the ones most sought after to save our eyes as we work way too late into the evening (*glances nervously at the timestamp on this post*), light themes are far more readable in bright daylight, so I have, begrudgingly, talked myself into adding a light theme to my personal website.  If you visit <a href="https://zmyaro.com">zmyaro.com</a> from a browser that supports color scheme detection, and your system/browser is set to light theme, you will automatically get the brand new first iteration of it.  It is still a bit of a work in progress, but I hope this convinces web devs around the world (or, at least, in the offices of Google and parts of Facebook), if I can find a way to take my lovingly crafted dark theme and accommodate folks who prefer to browse the Internet in direct sunlight, perhaps you could make your styles a little easier on my eyes at 2:30 in the morning?
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: smaller;">
						(Also, while this was not a priority for a low-traffic personal website, it is worth noting the <em>best</em> user experience is to detect the prefered color scheme by default and then provide an option to override just for your app.  PaintZ, for instance, supports this.)
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						On a side note, I want to once again thank <a href="https://github.com/Armin2208/Windows-Auto-Night-Mode" target="_blank">Windows 10 Auto Dark Mode by Armin2208</a>, which automatically switches your Windows system theme to light at sunrise and dark at sunset.  I highly recommend it if you are also impatient to see that feature built into Windows by default.

			<title>Workshop Scramble Anniversary/COVID-19 Update</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2020-12-25</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						Can you believe <a href="https://zmyaro.com/games/wss" target="_blank"><i>Workshop Scramble</i></a> is 3 years old??  Neither could I, because it's only 2 years old; this year has just apparently destroyed my ability to calculate time.  Anyway, while a lot of inProd priorities had to shift due to *gestures vaguely at the state of the world right now*, I wanted to do something slightly positive at the end of the year, so <i>Scramble</i> is getting a free anniversary update that adds the COVID-19 relief workshop.  In <i>Workshop Scramble</i>'s spirit of helping people in need around holidays, this unranked mode links you to charities you can donate to after you finish playing so your impact can extend beyond the game world.
					</p>
					<p>
						Stay safe, take care, and see you with some new stuff in the new year 💝

					<p>
						Whether you are (hopefully safely) visiting family for Christmas, or staying in lockdown with flatmates, here's a new game you can play: <i>Dr. Magnethands</i>, the tabletop RPG for three or more drunk people, now available as a convenient phone app!
					</p>
					<p>
						If you're saying, &ldquo;Didn't you already make that in 2016?&rdquo; yes, but then Google killed a service that app needed to run.  Now, after a few years' hiatus, Dr. Magnethands is back with some new (Google-free) stuff under the hood, a couple new tricks (dark theme is go!), and ready for you to once again enjoy the simplest, least serious TTRPG you've ever played (alcohol optional).  Try it now at <a href="http://magnethands.fun" target="_blank">magnethands.fun</a>.

			<title>PaintZ v3.2</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2020-11-30</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<img src="https://zmyaro.com/blog/2020-11-30/paintz_3_2.png" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="PaintZ v3.2." />
					<p>
						It's Cyber Monday, and for the low, low price of free again, we have the brand new PaintZ v3.2!  What makes it different from v3.1.1?  Well...
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Added transparent selection option</li>
						<li>Text no longer rasterizes immediately when the text box loses focus</li>
						<li>Duplicated and pasted selections now appear at the top-left corner of the visible canvas</li>
						<li>Selecting the canvas pulls focus</li>
						<li>Added pointer coordinates on the bottom bar (in sufficiently wide windows)</li>
						<li>Added canvas gridlines option</li>
						<li>Added gray and brown to toolbar color palette</li>
						<li>Added more line width options</li>
						<li>Added more text size options</li>
						<li>Added keyboard shortcut (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd>) to reset zoom level to 100%</li>
						<li>Added support for numpad +/- for zoom in/out keyboard shortcuts</li>
						<li>Added little hints of color to previously-monochromatic buttons</li>
						<li>Added new styling to keyboard shortcut hints in dialog boxes</li>
						<li>Added slight animation when the top toolbar shrinks as the window is narrowed</li>
						<li>Added &ldquo;About&rdquo; page</li>
						<li>Added &ldquo;Privacy&rdquo; page</li>
						<li>Added service worker caching (with app cache fallback)</li>
						<li>Fixed not being able to copy/cut a freeform selection via keyboard shortcut or browser clipboard menu</li>
						<li>Fixed not being able to copy/cut text from dialog boxes</li>
						<li>Fixed some keyboard shortcuts not working when typing a zoom level</li>
						<li>Fixed not being able to use zoom keyboard shortcuts while editing text</li>
						<li>Fixed browser open/save dialogs opening on <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>/<kbd>S</kbd> instead of PaintZ's while editing text</li>
						<li>Fixed browser help opening on <kbd>F1</kbd> instead of PaintZ's while editing text</li>
						<li>Fixed clipboard manager listening to clipboard events too early</li>
						<li>Fixed pressing <kbd>X</kbd> adding an unnecessary global variable</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						It's all rolling out now at <a href="https://paintz.app" target="_blank">paintz.app</a>!  As always, I remain thankful for everyone who uses PaintZ, and especially to a few folks who sent nice messages over this year of lockdown while I worked on v3.2.  This update was going to come either way, and so will v3.3 and v4.0, but those little reminders of how many people I will never know find this app helpful are really gratifying motivators, especially in this mess of a year.
					</p>
					<p>
						And, finally, of course, if you're feeling thankful, any support <a href="https://patreon.com/zmyaro" target="_blank">on <del>Ko-fi</del>Patreon</a> is also appreciated 🌼

			<title>PortalZ Developer Commentary</title>

						Last week, I released <a href="http://portalz.zmyaro.com/downloads/2020" target="_blank"><i>PortalZ: The 2020 Slice</i></a>.

I would have liked to include a developer commentary mode like the original <i>Portal</i>, but in lieu of that, <a href="http://portalz.zmyaro.com/commentary" target="_blank">I added some written developer notes on the <i>PortalZ</i> website</a>.

			<title>Dessert Projects Section Added</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/desserts</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						As desserts go, I am not the biggest fan of cake, so I have kind of turned it into a tradition that every year for my birthday, I make myself a dessert project that mashes up multiple non-cake desserts.
					</p>
					<p>
						When I was really little, my mother was very kindly willing to make us whatever birthday cake we requested, but when I started requesting various non-cake things, it gradually evolved into the “if you want something done your way, do it yourself” take-over-the-kitchen-for-the-week monstrosity that it is today.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are not really any rules, but I generally try to incorporate one thing each year I had never made before or is somehow experimental, I try to make everything but the serving dish entirely edible, and I try not to use much food coloring—at most, I use a little to enhance a color that is already there. (The one place I cheat on that “rule” is if I am using something that has already been artificially colored, like Jell-O.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, yes, making any of these produces a good bit of extra food not pictured, but definitely shared with the people who partake in the pretty part of the “cake”.
					</p>
					<p style="font-style: italic;">
						This section for <a href="https://zmyaro.com/desserts" target="_blank">my dessert projects</a> has been added under my shenanigans, including <a href="https://zmyaro.com/desserts/2020" target="_blank">my newest one from last month</a>.

					<h2>Why a non-gender-coded third-person pronoun?</h2>
					<p>
						Myriad people benefit from the availability of non-gender-coded personal pronouns.  Obviously such terms are necessary for cases in which a person's gender is not known.  But normalizing the regular use of non-gender-coded pronouns are also useful in cases in which people might discriminate or make assumptions based on gender.  And of course, the community that has brought the most attention to the matter in recent years has been the nonbinary and genderqueer community—people who do not necessarily identify with female-coded pronouns like “she” or male-coded pronouns like “he”.
					</p>
					
					<h2>So no singular “they”?</h2>
					<p>
						Read the rest of this for how I ended up at “xe”, but let me say up front: Nothing in this post is permission to call people who prefer “they” by anything but their preferred pronouns.
					</p>
					<p>
						Having gotten that out of the way, it is true we could just live with “they” as both singular and plural—we already do that in second-person with “you” (though if I were not a few centuries late to the debate, I might also argue against the loss of separate singular and plural second-person pronouns 😛).  However, while not absolutely vital, it is very convenient, in relevant situations to be able to specify whether you mean an individual or a group.  That is why explicitly plural terms like “yous” and “y'all” have started catching on in second-person.  For a simple example, with “xe” as singular and “they” as plural, the difference is clear between, “I watched Tay's team; I thought xe played well,” and, “I watched Tay's team; I thought they played well.”
					</p>
					<p>
						There is the bonus of it being more straightforward for people learning English—it is extremely common, in second-person, for people to say “you is” because it makes more sense to use the singular verb when referring to a single person, even if it is officially incorrect.  Using an explicitly singular pronoun avoids that confusion as well.
					</p>
					
					<h2>How I got here</h2>
					<p>
						My path here arguably started in the 2006-2007 school year, when my English teacher corrected something I had written, in which I had used “they” to refer to a singular person of unknown gender, noting I should use “he or she” instead.  At the time, I thought “they” was exclusively plural, so her note seemed a valid correction according to the current rules of English grammar.  But while I used it, “he or she” always seemed cumbersome, and I wanted a term that could function like “they”, but specifically singular, and none existed.
					</p>
					<p>
						After a few years, I reached out to a transgender friend who had mentioned non-gender-specific third-person singular pronouns before, and learned a bit more about the non-standardized ones in use, such as xir, hir, and zir.
					</p>
					<p>
						I continued to keep the matter in the back of my mind, but no proposed non-gender-coded third-person singular personal pronoun was standardized.  Eventually around 2016-2017, I realized it had been a decade, and I decided to pick one.
					</p>
					
					<h2>The contenders</h2>
					<p>
						Many have been put forth, but some notable ones include “e”, “hir”, “ne”, “s/he”,“xe”, and “ze”.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was not terribly fond of “hir” and “s/he” because they were kind of implicitly combinations of “he” and “she”, which seemed less useful for people who identified outside the gender binary.
					</p>
					<p>
						Using “e”/“em” made a lot of sense, but had the issue that some accents pronounce leading “h”s silently (like most Americans do with “hour” or “herb”), so “e” would parse as “he” to them.  (That said, I would still be a big supporter of “e”/“em” if it caught on.)
					</p>
					<p>
						I recognize at this point it becomes even more subjective, but I preferred ones like “ne”, “xe”, and “ze” over ones like “xir” and “zir” because they are the easiest for people to swap in place of “he” or “she”—we already have people complaining saying, “No person is an island,” is somehow vastly inferior to, “No man...” so at least this way, “Let xe who is without sin...” reduces that as much as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						So down to just ones like “ne”, “xe”, and “ze”.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Why xe?</h2>
					<p>
						Ultimately, it was subjective, but there were some things it aligned well with that led me to prefer it over the other 2:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The pronunciation being phonetically similar to the “th” sound in “they”/“them”/“their”/“theirs”, making it more familiar to people already using those words (though that is also true of “ze”)
						</li>
						<li>
							𝒙 being commonly used in math to represent an unknown value (though that is also true of “ne” with 𝒏)
						</li>
						<li>
							Mx. being adopted as a gender-neutral alternative to Mr. and Ms.
						</li>
						<li>
							The Japanese 「Xジェンダー」 (“X-gender”) being roughly the equivalent of “genderqueer” (or anyone not expressly female or male)
						</li>
						<li>
							The Spanish -x suffix (as in “Latinx”) catching on as a neutral alternative to the gendered -a and -o (as in “Latina” and “Latino”)
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Thus, “xe”/“xem”/“xer”/“xers”.
					</p>
					
					<h2>How do I say/use it?</h2>
					<p>
						“Xe” is pronounced “zee” (like the first syllable of “xenolinguistics”).
						<br />
						“Xem” ⇒ “zem” or “zəm” (rhymes with “them”).
						<br />
						“Xer” ⇒ “zer” or “zər” (can rhyme with “her” or “their”).
					</p>
					<p>
						“He ate his sandwich by himself.  Someone asked him if it was his sandwich, and he confirmed it was his.”
						<br />
						“She ate her sandwich by herself.  Someone asked her if it was her sandwich, and she confirmed it was hers.”
						<br />
						“Xe ate xer sandwich by xemself.  Someone asked xem if it was xer sandwich, and xe confirmed it was xers.”
						<br />
						“They ate their sandwiches by themselves.  Someone asked them if they were their sandwiches, and they confirmed they were theirs.”
					</p>
					
					<h2>Additional notes:</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Some people use the spelling “xir” or “xyr” instead of “xer”.  As far as I know, the reason usually just comes down to the spelling you were introduced to first, but I also, just personally, feel as though “xer” fits in better with the already-standardized third-person pronouns.
						</li>
						<li>
							Early on, I referred to “he” and “she” as “male-coded” and “female-coded”, respectively, because that is how they are generally viewed, but it is worth noting not <em>everyone</em> who uses those pronouns identifies as “male” or “female”, so it is still good to confirm rather than assuming.
						</li>
						<li>
							Finally, I feel as though I need to reiterate: this post is not to be used as justification for you to disregard anyone's preferred pronouns.
						</li>
					</ul>

			<title>Why Pride?</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2019-07-19</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						Roc Pride Festival is tomorrow!  I figured I would briefly mention why I care about Pride stuff.  I spent several years not wanting being queer to be a major part of my identity (“Cishet people do not need to ‘come out’ or remind people who they are, so why should I?”), and in many ways, that is still my stance, but even from there, I have started being more “aggressively” or “overtly” queer—having a rainbow flag up, wearing more Pride flag colors, etc.  To me, that accomplishes a few important things: 1) it tells other queer people they are not alone, 2) it tells other queer people they can safely be their queer selves around me, and 3) it prevents bigots who want to ignore/erase the existence of queer people from doing so.  Pride is that sentiment on steroids.  It shows queer people just how many other queer people live in their town (and beyond), it gives them a much larger space in which to safely be their queer selves, and it sends a massive message to everyone in power who wants to erase us that we do and will continue to exist and persist.

			<title>Rant: Emoji</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2016-05-13</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						You may have heard about <a href="http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16160-emoji-professions.pdf" target="_blank">a recent proposal to include gendered profession emoji</a>.  If you have not, the basic idea is to allow the woman (U+1F469) and man (U+1F468) emoji to be combined with others to represent various professions.  While I do not have a reason to oppose profession emoji (other than the common complaint about there being too many emoji), I do oppose pushing these emoji in the name of diversity and representation.
					</p>
					<figure data-side="right">
						<img src="https://zmyaro.com/blog/2016-05-13/emoji_skin_tone.png" alt="Unicode 8.0 skin tone modifiers" style="width: 100%; max-width: 300px;" />
						<figcaption>Unicode 8.0 skin tone modifiers (from <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2014/11/04/emoji-diversity-skin-tone-modifier" target="_blank">Mac Rumors</a>)</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						Issues of representation and diversity in emoji were in the news not that long ago when <a href="http://blog.unicode.org/2015/06/announcing-unicode-standard-version-80.html" target="_blank">Unicode 8.0</a> introduced skin tone modifiers.  Until Apple's color emoji gained popularity, most computers rendered emoji like any other text&mdash;in the text's font color.  The font color could, of course, be set by whatever software was rendering the text.  Want to honor the Wicked Witch of the West?  Set the font color to green and give her a thumbs up (U+1F44D).  After all, the percent sign (U+0025) does not tell you what color it should be; why should any other character?
					</p>
					<p>
						Color emoji took considerable control away from content creators.  Suddenly, if you wanted to use the &ldquo;back with leftwards arrow above&rdquo; (U+1F519) emoji, you were out of luck on the platforms on which it always rendered in blue unless that fit with your app's color scheme.  For the first time, a huge number of characters had the ability to tell font rendering programs what color they wanted to be, and designers and content creators had no say in the matter.
					</p>
					<p>
						Even with the introduction of various color emoji sets (or &ldquo;smilies&rdquo;, as we used to call them in the U.S.), emoji remained gender- and racially-neutral.  The yellow smiley face used to be virtually universally recognized as representing a happy human face without any indicators of gender, race, or any other physical traits&mdash;it remained as unbiased as the classic &ldquo;:)&rdquo;.  It was only when Apple released emoji with caucasian skin tones that people took issue.  To be perfectly clear, I think people were absolutely right to oppose Apple's change&mdash;by explicitly representing one racial group, Apple had implicitly excluded all others.  I do, however take issue with the Unicode consortium's solution.
					</p>
					<p>
						The introduction of skin tone modifiers suddenly made font color selection a choice that could be made by the typeface, and while emoji were no longer limited to a single skin tone, they <em>were</em> still limited to six.  Once again, by including selected groups instead of opening emoji to the full range of possible font colors, every other group had been implicitly excluded.
					</p>
					<figure data-side="right">
						<img src="https://zmyaro.com/blog/2016-05-13/police_emoji.png" alt="Google police officer emoji" style="max-width: 120px;" />
						<figcaption style="max-width: 192px;">Google's gender-neutral police officer emoji</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>
						This brings me to this newest proposal.  In the past, profession emoji, such as the police officer (U+1F46E) have not had specified genders, and while some fonts contanied gendered versions of the character, others, such as Google, kept them as androgynous as the first smilies, and that decision is important.  As I stated before, as soon as you modify emoji to explicitly represent specific groups, you implicitly exclude all others.  By gendering profession emoji, you implicitly exclude non-binary individuals.  Additionally, you exclude anyone whose definition of his/her own masculinity or femininity does not match Google's representation.  These modifiers do not include long-haired males, short-haired females, people who express gender identity with facial hair, and, obviously, anyone without brown hair.
					</p>
					<p>
						Instead of continuing to add and add until emoji capture every person's unique traits, consider moving emoji back toward the more abstract representations they once were, and stop letting the text tell the application how it should look.  The more emoji cease to be neutral and try to represent specific traits, the more it becomes apparent just how many more unique traits exist in humanity than can possibly be represented, and the more groups get implicitly excluded.

			<title>Review: Her</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2014-03-17</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						I finally watched <i>Her</i> today.  As someone with interests in both AI development and philosophy, I thought it was quite excellent.  I was not a fan of the musical choices, but the writing and directing made the characters feel very real, and the movie deserves major kudos for that.  I thought the ending felt a bit cop-out-y, but I was not any more sure of where the story was going to go than the writers seemed to be.
					</p>
					<h3>Story: 6/7</h3>
					<p>
						The characters were very well-written.  My only complaint was the rather anticlimactic ending.  It fit the movie, but for lack of a better way to describe it, it felt as though the writers just had an ending happen out of nowhere because the movie needed to end.
					</p>
					<h3>Visuals/cinematography: 5/7</h3>
					<p>
						Not bad, but nothing exceptional.
					</p>
					<h3>Music/sound: 3/7</h3>
					<p>
						Some of the music fit the movie, but some of it just started to annoy me.  It felt as though it got in the way of what was happening rather than enhancing the moment as it should have.  Kudos, though, to whoever was in charge of the various sound effects for different OSes.
					</p>
					<h3>Overall: 6/7</h3>
					<p>
						This movie delivered on everything I hoped it would (and a few things I hoped to be wrong about).  It was an excellent story about human interaction, human-computer interaction, and humans and AIs handling existential crises.  A few things here and there felt ever so slightly off, but I still highly recommend this movie.

			<title>Rant: Google, Stop Killing Things - Part 4: I Will Not Use Keep</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2013-03-21</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						As you may have heard, <a href="https://drive.google.com/keep" target="_blank">Google Keep</a> is live (for real this time).  I, for one, will not be switching to it.  The reason is simple.  As Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/fall-spring-clean.html" target="_blank">has</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/fall-sweep.html" target="_blank">shown</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/more-spring-cleaning-out-of-season.html" target="_blank">us</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/04/spring-cleaning-in-spring.html" targe="_blank">with</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/spring-cleaning-in-summer.html" target="_blank">its</a> &ldquo;<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/09/more-spring-cleaning.html" target="_blank">spring</a> <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/12/winter-cleaning.html" target="_blank">cleaning</a>&rdquo; <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html" target="_blank">events</a> (and most notably, for me, with the death of Google Reader), it is a big company that does a lot of things, and it does not always want to keep doing all those things.  I do not see Keep as being hugely beneficial to Google as a business, so I could easily see it getting killed in a year or two.  On top of that, Google Killed its last note-taking product, Google Notebook, in <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/fall-spring-clean.html" target="_blank">a previous &ldquo;spring cleaning&rdquo;</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						My preferred notes app right now is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.akproduction.notepad" target="_blank">AK Notepad</a>, a lightweight version of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.threebanana.notes" target="_blank">Catch Notes</a> (both are made by the same company).  The reason I intend to stay with AK/Catch is the same reason <a href="http://evernote.com" target="_blank">Evernote</a> users should stick with Evernote: <strong>note taking apps are what these companies do</strong>.  A company like Catch or Evernote is not going to kill its note taking app during &ldquo;spring cleaning&rdquo; because then <strong>the company would not exist</strong>.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						On a side note (no pun intended), this could, arguably, be used as a reason to pick Facebook over Google+: Google+ is part of a social <em>strategy</em> for Google, but social <em>is</em> Facebook.  Without a social network, Google would control a bit less of the Internet than it does.  Without a social network, Facebook <strong>would not exist</strong>.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						<strong>Edit (2013-07-30):</strong> Apparently I underestimated Catch's desire to exist.  Catch has announced it will soon be killing Catch Notes “to take the company in a different direction.”  Evernote's UX is bad enough that I am willing to give Google Keep a shot (at least until a decent competitor comes along).

			<title>Rant: Google, Stop Killing Things - Part 3: What Will Be Next To Go?</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2013-03-18</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						Since it is apparent Google's &ldquo;spring cleaning&rdquo; was not a one-time thing, I am starting to wonder what other Google products may be on the chopping block soon.  Here are some thoughts.
					</p>
					<h4><a href="http://feedburner.google.com" target="_blank">FeedBurner</a></h4>
					<p>
						The death of Google Reader AND iGoogle basically removes Google from the RSS game on the feed <em>reading</em> side, but FeedBurner is still around serving feeds.  Will Google choose to close down FeedBurner and abandon RSS completely, or do enough sites use FeedBurner to make it worth keeping around?
					</p>
					<h4><a href="https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas" target="_blank">Google Tasks</a></h4>
					<p>
						Google Tasks is a fantastic product.  It is conveniently built into Gmail and Google Calendar, and it has a lot of very nice mobile apps (even if none are from Google).  On the other hand, there has been zero activity on the product in quite a while&mdash;often a sign that Google is preparing to kill it.  In addition, the recently leaked Google Keep includes checklist functionality, which may replace Google Tasks.  Overall, though, I get the impression that Google Tasks is a product a lot of people use on a day-to-day basis, but not enough for it to influence Google.
					</p>
					<h4><a href="https://groups.google.com" target="_blank">Google Groups</a></h4>
					<p>
						I actually thought Google Groups was close to death a couple times in the past.  The recent redesigns have breathed some new life into it, but it still does not seem to be most people's go-to mailing list or forum solution outside of Google.  On top of that, Google seems to be pushing Google+Communities as its preferred way for users to communicate within a group.
					</p>
					<h4><a href="http://google.com/webfonts" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts</a></h4>
					<p>
						This is mostly on the grounds that Google Web Fonts still has its pre-Google+ UI, whereas nearly every surviving product that is not near death has seen a redesign.  It could be that Google recognizes that Web Fonts has a perfectly usable UI...or it could be that Google does not intend to continue working on its Web Fonts site.
					</p>
					<h4><a href="http://talk.google.com" target="_blank">Google Talk</a> (as we know it)</h4>
					<p>
						Let me be clear: I am not predicting the death of Google Talk.  What I AM saying is I could see Google moving to a new instant messaging service that is not based on standards like XMPP.  Rumors of a new messaging service codenamed &ldquo;Babble&rdquo; have begun to surface, and it is likely we will see the future of Google chat services at I/O in May.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition, Google Talk voice and video chat are likely to be shut down as they get replaced by Google+Hangouts.  When they work, I actually prefer Google Talk video chats over Hangouts&mdash;particularly on mobile where the app requires less resources&mdash;but Hangouts are definitely more reliable, and they are clearly where Google is focusing its engineering efforts.

			<title>Rant: Google, Stop Killing Things - Part 2: Google Buzz</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/blog/2013-03-15</link>
			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						A surprisingly large number of my friends in high school used Google Buzz.  It had a rocky start, but once we got used to it we realized it was a much more convenient and versatile social platform than Facebook.  Even just the fact that you could attach multiple photos from a given link was a great improvement.  Not to mention the convenience of having it integrated right into Gmail.  Fast forward to the end of 2011.  Google+ was still in an invite-only adults-only test phase, but Google decided that was a good time to kill Buzz.  No migrating posts from Buzz to G+; no giving loyal Buzz users access to G+; the Buzz tab in Gmail just...disappeared.  Why could Buzz not cleanly merge into G+?  The posts looked identical on my profile.  A Buzz &ldquo;Like&rdquo; is basically the equivalent of a +1.  Given that someone was able to write a program that used Buzz and Facebook's APIs to make Facebook comments appear on Buzz and Buzz comments appear on Facebook, I am certain <em>someone</em> in Google could have been smart enough to figure out how to import Buzz posts into G+.
					</p>
					<p>
						But no, one day we woke up and Buzz was just gone.  And what did my Buzz loving friends realize?  Why, they realized that from before Buzz was given to them and after it was taken away, Facebook had reliably stuck around.  It is no wonder I cannot get those friends to leave FB for G+.  Heck, with all the good Google products that get killed, I am wondering if I should start running my own e-mail server in case they announce Gmail going down.  After all, there are even more alternatives for Gmail users than for Wave and Reader users combined!

			<description>
				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						I am going to leave Google Wave out of this.  Wave was not incredibly popular or successful.  I will accept that for the duration of this rant series.
					</p>
					<p>
						What about the other products Google is killing?  They are dying at different speeds, but many of Google's products&mdash;including a lot that brought me to Google in the first place&mdash;are being killed.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is, of course, prompted by the announcement that Google Reader would be going down.  Let me talk for a moment about my experience with RSS aggregators.  I was not a huge fan of the ones built into browsers.  I think IE8's was the best, and even that was not so great.  Then I found iGoogle.  Keep in mind this is before I was a Gmail user and way before I was a Google Docs user.  Anyway, following my discovery of iGoogle, it remained my homepage on every computer I used for a good 5-7 years.  Actually, it is technically <em>still</em> my homepage; I just stopped visiting it regularly because Chrome is set to &ldquo;Continue where I left off.&rdquo;  My mom also still has iGoogle as her home page and it will remain there until Google shuts it down <em>because there is no good alternative.</em>  So iGoogle was my first online RSS aggregator.  It conveniently let me display any feed on my home page as a widget.  Eventually, I collected too many feeds for that to be convenient, so I poked around and discovered Google had an even better tool for the job than iGoogle: Google Reader.  You know what made Google Reader fantastic?  It WORKED.  Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs, all the big name Google products saw redesign after redesign.  Google Reader just WORKED.  The only time Google Reader got a redesign was when the execs behind Google+ MADE THEM do a redesign.  And now that that is over, Google Reader is solid once again.  In fact, if Google just let Reader sit as is without any developers working on it IT WOULD PROBABLY HAVE LESS DOWNTIME THAN GMAIL AND MORE ACTIVE USERS THAN GOOGLE+.

				<![CDATA[
					<p>
						Google used to care so much about standards and openness.  They had the most standards-compliant browser, an RSS/Atom feed aggregator, and search results from social circles meant Buzz, Twitter, Flickr, and anyone else willing to let Google index its data.
					</p>
					<p>
						Now Google is basically at the top—or close enough that it feels like it is.  Suddenly they have lost interest in openness and standards.  Now -webkit- prefixes and chrome.* APIs are going to make Chrome the new IE.  Google's focus has shifted from the open web to the Chrome web.  Google+ is replacing Google's old work at aggregating social data from a variety of networks.  In Buzz and Reader, users could pull in tweets, Flickr uploads, blog posts, RSS feeds, FriendFeed content, and more.  Google+ keeps everything tightly under Google's control.
					</p>
					<p>
						Where is this going to go next?  I could definitely see Google abandoning XMPP Google Talk for some non-standards-based expansion of Google+ Messenger.  One thing is for sure, the Google that built its image as a company that put the interests of the Internet as a whole before its own interests is gone.  Google is very quickly ceasing to be special and becoming yet another rich company.
					</p>
					<p>
						Long story short, Google was calling for open standards when others were in charge.  Now it is on top, it is happy to take advantage of that, and its products are so nice that we are not going to stop them.  At least I am not.  I like Gmail too much.
					</p>
					<p>
						And, oddly enough, it is now <em>Microsoft</em> calling for open standards.  Funny how these things go...

						When I spend a lot of time at someone's house Google Latitude Location History always thinks I was at the nearest business instead.  You have my contact list, Google!  Why would you think I was at a business I have never heard of instead of, for instance, my girlfriend's house, which I visit very frequently and is closer to my GPS- and wi-fi-based locations than the nearby business suggestions??  Or why not look at my Navigation history, which is saved IN THE SAME APP and maybe conclude that if my GPS location is close enough to it, the address I entered there was probably where I went?!

			<title>Concerns Regarding “The Snowmen”</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2012-12-10</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					I am concerned about the <i>Doctor Who</i> Christmas special, “The Snowmen.”  I am afraid it will suffer from the same problems as “The Wedding Of River Song”<small> (s6ep13)</small>.  That is, it will try to cram too much into a single one-part episode and end up feeling rushed or incomplete.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consider the number of things this episode is going to have happen (in no particular order):
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The effect the loss of the Ponds has had on The Doctor needs to be shown</li>
					<li>The Doctor will be convinced to come out of retirement.</li>
					<li>The TARDIS will regenerate.</li>
					<li>The new companion, Clara, will be introduced.</li>
					<li>The characters Madame Vastra, Jenny, and Strax will be fleshed out more than in “A Good Man Goes To War”<small> (s6ep7)</small>.</li>
					<li>The new villain, Doctor Simeon, will be introduced.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Okay, so introducing a one-episode villain is not a big deal, but the TARDIS regenerating and the introduction of Clara are kind of big.  Also, time needs to be dedicated to showing The Doctor's state after losing the ponds.  Episodes like “A Town Called Mercy”<small> (s7ep3)</small> were intended to show how The Doctor's companions were part of his moral compass.  “The Snowmen” needs to show how The Doctor has changed without them.

			<title>Rant: I Want You To Take My Money, But You Want Me To Want To Keep It (Part 1: Nintendo)</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2012-11-23</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					Thanksgiving is over, so the time for holiday shopping has officially begun.  This has, of course, made me think about what sort of things <i>I</i> want this year.  However, thinking through the companies whose products I normally drool over, I am realizing they must want me to keep my money this year.
				</p>
				<p>
					First off, Nintendo.  Anyone who knows me probably knows I am quite a Nintendo fanboy, and have been for years.  In 2006, I drooled over the Wii and drove from store to store for months until I finally got one.  When I heard Nintendo was working on a successor to the Wii, I was excited...until I saw what it was.  The Wii was revolutionary, but the Wii U seems to fall short in every possible respect.  And now I shall complain about them in no particular order.
				</p>
				<p>
					My first complaint is that, Nintendo has been bragging about the Wii U's graphics...and ignoring the fact that the Xbox 360 was capable of comparable graphics <i>before the Wii came out</i>!  Nintendo has never been known for being the best at graphics or processing power, but it also never tried to brag when it knew it was behind.  Now it is bragging that its next-gen console has current-gen graphics.
				</p>
				<p>
					Next, Miiverse, Nintendo's new gaming-oriented social network, will probably fail about as badly as Apple's music-oriented social network, “Ping.”  At best, people might visit Miiverse occasionally with questions, but it is unlikely most users will check for Miiverse posts as frequently as Facebook, Google+, or Twitter.  Also, when did “Yeah” become a verb?
				</p>
				<p>
					Another complaint is the fact that the Wii Menu exists at all on the Wii U.  This is the same as one of my big complaints about Windows 8: If your new OS is so great, why is your old OS hacked onto it?  The Wii was able to play GameCube games pretty seamlessly.  Why is Wii U backward compatibility such a mess?
				</p>
				<p>
					Maybe it would help if Nintendo actually had some decent sort of account system to sync games from Wii's to Wii U's (and maybe DSi's to 3DSes).  I am a Club Nintendo member, and my Wii Shop Channel account is linked to my Club Nintendo membership.  Why not have Club Nintendo, Miiverse, my Nintendo eShop purchases, and maybe even all that friend code nonsense be synced with one central account?  How can Nintendo expect people to trust its online gaming, social networking, or digital download offerings if it gives no evidence it cares about having a reliable backend.  I trust that when I buy a game from the Google Play Store or the Windows Store, that purchase is saved to my Google/Microsoft account and can be accessed from any Android/Windows 8 device I sign into, should the download fail or my original device break.  When I buy a game from the Wii Shop Channel/Nintendo eShop, I trust that that game will be on that console at that time and nothing more.  If anything happens to my Wii, I have no idea if I will get that game back.  Similarly, if I want to play a game online from an Xbox or Windows 8 device, I just need to exchange gamer tags, which are, again, linked to Microsoft accounts.  If my Wii breaks, I have to exchange Wii numbers and friend codes for every friend and every game.  I have no idea who thought that up, but he or she clearly does not understand UX.
				</p>
				<p style="font-size: smaller;">
					(I should mention, a lot of that is hypothetical.  I am not an Xbox or Windows 8 fan.  That said, the way those situations <i>would</i> play out is accurate.)
				</p>
				<p>
					One small penultimate complaint is about Nintendo TVii.  My main disappointment there, apart from the fact that the feature was not available at launch, is that the Wii U's only awesome feature is not even related to gaming.  In addition, the fact that it even lagged in the promo video greatly lowers my expectations.
				</p>
				<p>
					My last complaint is about the Wii U GamePad.  I will admit I found the idea of bringing the touch screen idea from the DS to console gaming kind of clever.  But, compared to something like Xbox SmartGlass, Nintendo's idea seems terrible.  Sure, there will likely be some awesome experiences that result from the combination of a controller and a touch screen, but there are so many situations where the GamePad will cause problems.
				</p>
				<p>
					Example #1: Someone makes a game that uses the GamePad for something.  Three of your friends come over to play multiplayer.  The Wii U only supports two GamePads at a time.  What do?
				</p>
				<p>
					Example #2: You are playing a game online using the Pro Controller.  You want to voice chat with the other players.  The headset must be plugged into the GamePad; not the Pro Controller or the Wii U console.  o_O
				</p>
				<p>
					Example #3: Every first-person shooter that could be made more awesome with the Wii Remote's precision will now be required to drop that in favor of some sort of touch screen gimmick.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, there is the issue of making every Wii U owner buy a Nintendo Wii U GamePad if he or she wants another.  Compare that to SmartGlass where just about any mobile device (my Galaxy Nexus, my dad's IdeaPad, my friend's Surface, my girlfriend's dad's iPad, etc.) can be that second screen.  Oh, and this second screen has multi-touch.  As one friend of mine likes to put it, “You are never finished buying a Nintendo product.”  This has never been more true than with the Wii U, which is technically not complete without four Wii Remotes, four Wii Nunchuks, a Wii Balance Board, two Wii U GamePads, and four Wii U Pro Controllers (plus, optionally, four Wii Classic Controllers or Classic Controller Pros).
				</p>
				<p>
					I feel like I probably will buy a Wii U at some point just to play <i>New Super Mario Bros. U</i>, <i>ZombiU</i>, and <i>Nintendoland</i>, but, at this point, the Wii U is nothing but a box of disappointments.  And a slate of disappointments.  And another controller.  And Wii Remotes.  And some other controllers.  All the controllers.
				</p>
				<p>
					(Also, yes, I realize I got off Wii U-specific complaints into general Nintendo complaints, but I suppose the complaints about Nintendo's online offerings also cover why I never bought a 3DS or DSi.)

			<title>“The Angels Take Manhattan” Predictions</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2012-09-28</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					Tomorrow will be the Ponds' last episode.  I wanted to throw out some last-minute predictions.  First though, some things that have been confirmed:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It will be set in Manhattan (duh).</li>
					<li>Amy will be trying to save Rory.</li>
					<li>Melody Pond/River Song will appear.</li>
					<li>The Weeping Angels will return to their old habit of sending people back in time (as in “Blink” (s3)) instead of breaking necks (as in “Time Of Angels” (s5)).</li>
					<li>They (presumably the Angels) are coming for Rory (according to The Doctor).</li>
					<li>One or more people will witness his/her/their own future(s).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>And now, my predictions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If The Statue Of Liberty is an Angel, I totally called it.</li>
					<li>The combination of Angels sending people back in time and Amy, Rory, and Melody being there makes me think they might reference one of the last couple times Melody was in New York (possibly when she was there with The Silence as a child - see “The Impossible Astronaut”/“Day Of The Moon” (s6)).</li>
					<li>“Time Of Angels” (s5) confirmed the Angels can “infect” people by looking people in their eyes.  I think this is going to happen to Rory.</li>
					<li>Amy is supposed to have a huge fear of the Weeping Angels (they were apparently her worst fear, according to “The God Complex” (s6)).  It is not usually referenced, but it may become important here.</li>
					<li>Rory always escapes death, so maybe he actually dies here.  Or maybe, because we would expect that to happen, Amy dies here.  Or maybe, since the first image for s6 set us up to expect that, Rory dies here.  Or maybe, since the trailer shows The Doctor telling Rory “they're coming for you,” they set us up to expect <i>Rory</i> to die, and <i>Amy</i> dies.  Or maybe they both get zapped back to 1969 and get to raise little Melody and live happily ever after apart from the whole stuck-back-in-time thing.  I do not know.</li>
				</ul>

			<title>Random Doctor Who Predictions</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2012-09-13</link>
			<description>
				<h3>1:</h3>
				<p>
					It is not exactly normal for The Doctor to switch back and forth between traveling on his own and traveling with his primary companion(s), as he is with Amy and Rory in season 7 (though I agree it <i>is</i> justifiable in this case).  What if all or part of season 7's episodes and/or <i>Pond Life</i> take place in The Doctor's timeline after “Angels Take Manhattan”?  It would certainly explain The Doctor's sadness in the last episode of <i>Pond Life</i> if he were trying to have adventures with the Ponds while knowing what will happen to them.
				</p>
				<h3>2:</h3>
				<p>
					Another (incompatible) theory: The Ponds' departure is supposed to be final, but nothing stops him from visiting Amy and Rory earlier in their timelines (like he did Rose at the end of “The End Of Time”).  What if the Ponds' departure in “Angels Take Manhattan” involves letting one or both Ponds survive, but prevents The Doctor from seeing them again (like Donna)?
				</p>
				<p>

			<title>Responses To Asylum Of The Daleks</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2012-09-02</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					Last year, after each episode of <i>Doctor Who</i>, I updated a wave with my latest comments and predictions.  That worked very well because wave was a great platform for letting me maintain that list <i>and</i> letting other people comment on what I said.  Since that is not really an option this year, I have decided to just put my comments in blog posts.  If you want to comment, you should do so on the Google+ where I link to the blog post (until I decide how I want to rewrite commenting into my blog, since Google broke my previous wave-based system).
				</p>
				<p>
					“Asylum Of The Daleks” was a great way to start the series...for the most part.  I will start with the things I did like, make a smooth-ish transition to my complaints, and end with my predictions.  Oh, and I will talk a bit about “Pond Life” (the prequel mini-series) as well.
				</p>
				<h2>SPOILERS FOLLOW.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</h2>
				<p>
					The episode starts off pretty well.  Seeing Skaro was kind of neat (despite potential continuity issues), and introducing a new type of Dalek-in-a-human was a surprising twist.  I enjoyed asylum itself largely because, having seen some old <i>Who</i>, I recognized some of the old Daleks.  I also liked how the episode made the Daleks seem like much more than mindless killing machines—both through the Daleks talking about having a concept of beauty, as well as things like Amy seeing other Daleks as regular people when viewing them from a Dalek's perspective.  Even though I predicted Oswin would be a Dalek from early on—though I was expecting another puppet, and I think the episode was written so I would expect that—I still really enjoyed not only the idea of a human in a Dalek shell, but also the ideas about what a person—or possibly any being—would perceive when put in a Dalek shell like that.  Finally, the ending.  I think a lot of fun things could result from this ending.  On one hand, the Daleks will no longer want to kill The Doctor, but, on the other hand, they no longer have the fear and respect(?) for him that they previously had.  Think about how many times The Doctor has stopped his enemies just with his reputation (e.g., “The Pandorica Opens,” (s5) “Silence In The Library” (s4)).
				</p>
				<p>
					The episode is not without its problems, however, and I do not mean Moffat trickiness (though there is that too).  I will start with “Pond Life.”  I liked the first four episodes of the mini-series.  Sure, they were short, but they were fun and silly.  The last episode turns sad out of nowhere.  I had no idea when this was taking place; initially I thought it was after “The Angels Take Manhattan” and The Doctor was trying to pretend Amy and Rory were still there but then it showed Amy kicking Rory out and I got really confused.  I tried to give the series the benefit of the doubt, though, and waited for “Asylum Of The Daleks.”  Unfortunately, it did not help.  If “Pond Life” were all supposed to be a direct prologue to s7ep1, it would have made sense to have all five episodes lead to the divorce, not have it just suddenly appear.  It got worse when they explained <i>why</i> they got divorced.  Given how Amy and Rory were portrayed in the past, they seem like a couple that could handle not being able to have more children (have they never heard of adoption?), not just jump to divorce.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, predictions.  I think the Amy/Rory situation is pretty much resolved because it was only supposed to be important for one scene.  What is not resolved, however, is Oswin.  While two actresses who played companions <i>did</i> show up in episodes as different characters (Freema Agyeman/Martha Jones as Adeola Oshodi in “Army of Ghosts” (s2) and Karen Gillan/Amy Pond as a soothsayer in “The Fires of Pompeii” (s4)), I do not think this is such a case.  It was known that Jenna-Louise Coleman was going to be the new companion long before “Asylum Of The Daleks” was finished.  Assuming Oswin is the new companion, I am concerned this is going to be another River Song-type story.  That is, The Doctor will meet her earlier in her life and travel with her while knowing how she will die.  You could argue that Oswin did not know The Doctor in “Asylum,” but I think she is good enough to be able to lie to The Doctor.  The whole “remember me” thing at the end definitely made me think she at least knew who she was.  This would be kind of annoying, but not surprising as Moffat has a history of reusing his storylines (Amelia's situation in “The Eleventh Hour” (s5) was about the same as Reinette's in “The Girl In The Fireplaec” (s2)).
				</p>
				<p>
					There is another interesting theory I have heard: Oswin was “assimilated” (to use the <i>Star Trek</i> term) by the Daleks and had access to the hive mind of all the Daleks, not just the ones in the asylum.  Therefore it is reasonable to conclude the Daleks have complete access to her mind as well.  It is possible the Daleks may create a copy of Oswin (we have had no shortage of clones in recent <i>Who</i> history--nearly every companion in new <i>Who</i> has had some sort of duplicate made*).  That duplicate could either be part of a Dalek plan from which The Doctor rescues her, or she could be set up to meet The Doctor as <i>part</i> of a Dalek plan.  In the latter case, since the Daleks have joined other residents of the universe in asking, “Doctor Who,” it is possible that Oswin might be part of a plan that leads The Doctor to the fields of Trenzalore.
				</p>
				<p style="font-size:smaller;">
					*Martha by the Sontarans in “The Sontaran Stratagem”/“The Poison Sky” (s4); Donna's mind in the Doctor-Donna in “Journey's End” (s4); Amy by the Flesh some time around the end of “Day Of The Moon” (s6), revealed in “The Almost People” (s6); Rory by the Nestene in “The Pandorica Opens”/“The Big Bang” (s5).

			<title>AndRant: Google Music for Jelly Bean</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2012-07-18</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					You may remember I ranted a bit about my experience with the leaked pre-release version of Google Music.  Since then a lot has changed in the app, and today Google released the “harder, better, faster, stronger” (according to the update news) Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean/JB) version of Google Music for Android (still compatible with pre-JB devices, of course).  A lot has changed since the 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich/ICS) version; in fact, in terms of functionality, this might be the most major change to the Android music experience since the Music app became Google Music.  This is good in some ways and annoying in other ways.  I have actually been using the app for a couple weeks (since Google I/O day), and these are my impressions.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="http://zmyaro.com/imgs/blog/2012/07/18/widget.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://zmyaro.com/imgs/blog/2012/07/18/widget.png" alt="The new Google Music home screen widget" /></a>
					Let us start with the good.  I have used the Music home screen widget since I first started using my old Droid a couple years ago, and this is the first major change it has seen on phones.  In addition to the current song and artist names, play/pause button, and next song button, the widget now includes album art and a thumbs up button.  I would personally prefer a rewind/previous song button over the thumbs up button, but I still think the updated widget is a fantastic improvement.
				</p>
				<p style="clear:right;">
					<a href="http://zmyaro.com/imgs/blog/2012/07/18/recent.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://zmyaro.com/imgs/blog/2012/07/18/recent.png" alt="The new recent music page, with the new playlist art, bottom action bar, and navigation header pointed out" /></a>
					The UI of the app itself has also seen some improvements.  While the old bottom action bar design minimized the space taken up by action bars, the new look maintains consistency across views and device types.  The addition of a top action bar on phones means the bottom action bar can now contain music controls—a feature that was removed in the ICS version to make room for the search and action overflow buttons.  Unfortunately, this UI change removed the tabs that used to occupy the top of the portrait UI in favor of using swipe gestures to switch pages.  What is irritating is, unlike the phone landscape or tablet UIs, there is no drop down list of pages, so getting from one page to another can take up to five swipes where it used to take a single tab press.  Hopefully that will be improved in a later update.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another improvement is the new recent music page.  In landscape mode on phones and in both orientations on tablets, it shows a 3D carosel of albums and playlists, but in portrait orientation on phones it used to show a simple list.  Now, instead, the portrait view contains large album and playlist images.  And on that note, playlist images are now made up of album art from the songs they contain—a major improvement.
				</p>
				<p style="clear:right;">
					<img src="http://zmyaro.com/imgs/blog/2012/07/18/honeycomb.png" alt="Song/album/artist names on Google Music for Android 3.x" />
					Another change (note that I do not refer to this one as an “improvement”) is to the Now Playing screen.  There are certainly improvements here.  For instance, additional controls fade in without needing to resize the album art (which was an annoyingly laggy animation on older devices).  But those improvements are overshadowed by lost functionality.  Since the first Music app in Android 1, it has been possible to long-press a song, album, or artist name to search for it on the web or in other apps like YouTube, Pandora, etc.  The first Google Music app (seen on an Android 3.x (Honeycomb) device in the screenshot) improved on this by letting you add a song to a playlist, view the whole album, or view all your albums by the artist, by tapping the song, album, or artist, respectively.  Finally, every version of the app since Android 1 has let you slide a song/album/artist name horizontally to see the rest of it if it is too long to fit on the screen.  This latest update removes all those features and, in most cases, offers no alternative ways to perform those actions.  There is only one reason I can think of for this change, which is it makes the UI more similar to the iPhone/iPod Touch music app, with basic controls at the bottom, big album art in the middle, seek/shuffle/repeat hidden by default, back button at the upper-left, and queue button at the upper-right.
				</p>
				<p>
					That brings me to the most major change in this update: Google has brought back the now playing queue.  Surprisingly, I do not approve.  I say surprisingly because when the Android Music app becaume Google Music, it removed the now playing queue, and that was one of my biggest complaints.  There are two reasons I am not happy to see it return.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first is that, as of ICS, the Google Music app was doing fine without it.  Sure, it was unpleasant on the first Google Music app for Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), but when ICS came along and standardized the “up” button as a means of navigation, everything got simpler.  If you started playing a song from an album, pressing the Google Music icon at the upper-left of the now playing screen would take you to that album.  If you started playing a song from a playlist, pressing the icon would take you to the playlist and scroll you to that song.  Updating that playlist meant updating the current queue.  In the new version of Google Music, pressing the Google Music icon from the now playing screen takes you back to the recent music screen, and if you add a song to the playlist you started from, you have to add it to the queue separately.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second reason I am not happy to see the now playing queue return is that it is buggy and unpredictable.  For instance, let us say you tapped a song in an album earlier in the day.  The app automatically added the rest of the album to the queue.  That makes sense.  Now, hours later, you select a song from a playlist.  That playlist gets added to the queue, <em>but the album you listened to earlier is still there</em>.  If you do not make a habit of clearing your queue before playing a new playlist, it can become a mess.
				</p>
				<p>
					This gets worse when you bring shuffle into the picture.  Let us say you have nothing in your queue and you select the first song in an album.  The album should start playing and, assuming shuffle is off, the rest of the album should be in the queue, in order.
					<br />
					<a href="http://zmyaro.com/imgs/blog/2012/07/18/shuffle_bug1.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://zmyaro.com/imgs/blog/2012/07/18/shuffle_bug1.png" class="fill" /></a>
					<br />
					Now you decide to enable shuffle.  Rather than the app moving to a random point in the queue when the song changes, as it has in every previous version of Music, it randomizes the order of items in the queue.  Not quite what I am used to, but acceptable.
					<br />
					<a href="http://zmyaro.com/imgs/blog/2012/07/18/shuffle_bug2.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://zmyaro.com/imgs/blog/2012/07/18/shuffle_bug2.png" class="fill" /></a>
					<br />
					Here is where things get strange.  If you then disable shuffle, the queue remains randomized rather than returning to its original order.
					<br />
					<a href="http://zmyaro.com/imgs/blog/2012/07/18/shuffle_bug3.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://zmyaro.com/imgs/blog/2012/07/18/shuffle_bug3.png" class="fill" /></a>
					<br />
					Combine that with the fact that selecting an item in a different album or playlist adds the whole playlist to the queue, and you can imagine how weird it can get to have parts of the queue shuffled and parts unshuffled (even more so when tracks get added by selecting Menu → Shuffle all on an album or playlist).
				</p>
				<p>
					So there you have it.  The latest version of Google Music for Android brings, among other things, some highly-requested features (including better playlist images), UI changes (updated home screen widget, consistent top action bar, music controls on bottom action bar, new Now Playing screen), and the return of the now playing queue.  If you have an Android 2.2+ device, go ahead and download the latest version from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.music" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

					So <i>finally</i>, after months of delays, I received my physical copy of brentalfloss's new CD, “Bits Of Me.”  This CD has been delayed so long since its original release date (which felt even longer to me, since I pre-ordered it) that Level Up ended up giving me a digital copy, but now I finally have the real signed physical disc.

					As you might have heard, we on the east coast U.S. were just hit by one of the worst summer storms in recent years (at least in terms of damage).  I am fine, as are my friends (the car I drove home from the storm in...slightly less so...), but we were without electricity and running water for several days.  Thankfully, unlike snowmageddon a couple years ago, we could actually drive out.  Anyway, now, only a few days after Amazon, my downtime has ended.  Hope everyone else made it through the storm okay.

					Hello, everyone,
					<br/>
					<img src="http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ls1meqYsgp1qhgzjro1_400.gif" alt="I'm back!" class="fill" />
				</p>
				<p>
					I finally did what I should have done long ago: bought a domain (thankfully zmyaro.com is not something anyone else would want to buy), set up a server and just hosted my site myself.  The downside is that means my site being up is dependent on me having working power (now that I have acknowledged that, prepare for record-breaking storms) and Internet, but the positive side is that I control everything, meaning I can build on top of whatever backend I want rather than being limited to static files (ugh).  To start, I am planning to rewrite my blog in PHP, which I expect to take several months (well, no, it will take a couple hours or days at most, but it will be interrupted by things like my job, social life, and other projects).  Eventually I am thinking of rewriting the whole site in NodeJS, but that will probably not happen for a while.  So...yeah, that is the state of things wrt my website.
				</p>
				<p>
					Oh, and for those who care about such things, the server is running Apache on Arch Linux.  [EDIT] The server is no longer on Arch.

			<title>The Update-less Update</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2012-01-11</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					As some of you might be aware, Verizon took away FTP access to personal websites a few months ago, which is the primary reason I stopped updating.  Some exciting stuff has happened since then, and I will hopefully post about that soon.  Unfortunately, I am also dealing with a ton of school-related stuff, but once first semester ends and I get all my college apps in (i.e. February), I will have much more time to devote to this (I am not saying that is when updates will start happening, just that that is the soonest I might have time).  If you want more content from me more frequently, you can circle me on <a href="http://profiles.google.com/zmyaro" target="_blank">Google+</a>.

			<title>Plaguing The Interwebz</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2011-04-19,googlewave.com!w+Akj2G-VqA</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					Every few years at my family's Pesach seder I have created something electronic to go along with the ten plagues.  Usually it was a PowerPoint presentation or an animation of some sort.  This year I decided to do something on a larger scale.  I decided that I would plague <i>the entire Internet</i>.  MUHAHAHAHA!! [insert stock footage of kittens running in fear as lightning flashes in the background]
				</p>
				<p>
					I have created a Chrome extension that, when installed, will inflict one of the plagues on every webpage you visit.  For legal reasons I could not <i>actually</i> kill the webmaster's first-born child, but all the plagues are in there...in some form or another.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can get the extension <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/kmcopldlooadgljinjpljijdmmgkjdlp" target="_blank">here</a>.  If you have Firefox or another decent, but non-Chrome browser, you can still try this out using my Ten Plagues bookmarklet, which can be found on my <a href="projects/chrome/index.html" target="_blank">extensions</a> page.

			<title>Update: New Visual Style</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2011-03-09,googlewave.com!w+cU-6uW66C</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					I have been talking about and working on this for a while, but now I finally finished my website's new visual style.  The wave theme was nice, but I have gotten bored of it.  The new look has a clear electronic look to it, which better reflects my interests.  In addition, each section of my website has a color associated with it, which can help you see where you are.
				</p>
				<p>
					I hope you like the new theme.  Oh, and happy <i>Brawl</i> day :)
				</p>
				<p style="font-size:smaller;">
					(The fact that this update is happening on the anniversary of <i>Brawl</i>'s North American release is a coincidence, but a good one :P)

			<title>Review: Inception, second viewing</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2011-01-17,googlewave.com!w+87N6EIdQA</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					When I first saw <i>Inception</i>, I thought it was awesome, but was not worth seeing more than once.  I discovered yesterday that I was definitely wrong.  Obviously a little bit of the fun is lost when you know what is going to happen instead of trying to figure out who is in whose dream.  But there is so much in the movie that I still found myself noticing plenty of things that I missed before or forgot about, and it is difficult to not still be impressed by the attention to detail in the huge dream worlds.  Even if you already saw <i>Inception</i>, I highly recommend renting the DVD/Blu-Ray.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are some of the things I learned from watching <i>Inception</i>:
					<ul>
						<li>Zombies in your head can be just as bad as zombies in your house</li>
						<li>Out-of-control existentialism causes problems</li>
						<li>Christopher Nolan is a genius</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>My rating:</b>
					<br/>
					Story: 5/7
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left:18px; display:inline-block;">
						The overall story was good, but many of the characters lacked depth
					</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Visuals: 7/7
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left:18px; display:inline-block;">
						The unique dream worlds looked incredible.  In addition, one trick that was particularly impressive was after Fischer gets out of the van with Browning: the camera pans so Browning is behind Fischer and when you see him he looks Eames again.
					</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Music: 7/7
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left:18px; display:inline-block;">
						Hans Zimmer.  'nuff said.
					</span>
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Overall: 7/7
					<br/>
					<span style="margin-left:18px; display:inline-block;">
						This is easily one of the best movies ever made.

			<title>Update: Return of the Rants</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2011-01-09,googlewave.com!w+P0MMHGTRA</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					I have not posted anything in a LONG time.  This is primarily because of school taking up most of my time and my various other projects taking up the rest.  But during this time I have typed up some rants about various subjects that I intend to post over the next few weeks.  Keep in mind that some of these were written as far back as last September, so they may refer to things that have already happened in the theoretical or future tense.

			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2010-11-27,googlewave.com!w+DrTNEyzbA</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					First off, I want to make it clear that this post contains no <i>Portal</i> references, despite the title.  Okay, on to the post.
				</p>
				<p>
					I realize that I have not been posting much on the site recently.  The main reason for this is school, but I also have several other projects that have taken priority over my site.  Unfortunately this will continue to be the case for a while, but I do have some things I wrote over the past couple months that I hope to post at some point.  In addition, you can follow <a href="http://google.com/profiles/zmyaro#buzz">my buzz</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now on to the next part.  HAPPY <span style="font-size:8pt">late</span> THANKSGIVING!  Well, assuming you live in the U.S.; otherwise happy Thursday-earlier-this-week.  I actually just got home last night from visiting my mother's family.  I know a ton of people are going to ask if I got the "enhanced pat-down".  Actually going through security was possibly the easiest it has ever been since TSA insanity started.  This was the case for both my flight leaving and coming back.  I do have one complaint however.  I happened to see the touch-screen controls for the X-ray scanner and they looked like Windows 3.  With how much those machines probably cost, is a pretty UI too much to ask?
				</p>
				<p>
					That is all for now.  Hopefully I will post more soon.  Particularly my review of the new <i>Harry Potter</i> movie (it is awesome).  I also have some other ideas on how to keep my website active.  For now, you should still be able to find me on Buzz on Wave.

			<title>Update: Better Organization</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2010-09-06,googlewave.com!w+TNC8BHXrD</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					I am returning to school tomorrow.  On one hand I am excited to go back because it is so awesome (please do not kill me, antimatter15), but on the other hand I still have things I meant to do this summer that I never finished.  Oh well.
				</p>
				<p>
					On a related note, going to school means I will only have one computer (and by "computer" I mean laptop or bigger; Droids do not count) with me.  So my old broken Windows laptop will not be coming with me to school.  This of course means that I need Linux and Windows on the same computer.  So I just had a fun time this weekend cleaning off my hard drive (which I discovered is 20 GB smaller than it is advertised to be) and reinstalling OSes.  Twice.  Fun fun fun.  But now everything works better than before.  Also funny thing: it took over an hour to install Windows and a long time (I do not remember exactly) to install the 70 or so updates, but it only took under 15 minutes to install Linux and less than that to install the >250 updates.  And before you say it, Sreenath, shut up.
				</p>
				<p>
					On another note related related to the start of school, I began writing a parody back in June (it was actually while I was in Israel, so if anyone from the trip saw me typing on my Droid, I might have been working on this).  I had intended to finish it in time for the start of school, but I still have lyrics I have not come up with.  It is yet another AVPM parody (I really need to find another source XD), and another "Get Back To Hogwarts" parody, except this time I have parodied essentially the entire scene.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aaanyway, like I said it still is not done, but I have a good chunk done (although not all polished), so I am going to put it out.  Kind of like the "Get Back To TJ" canary build.  And a funny thing is I bet none of my friends who have seen AVPM get what I mean by canary build.
				</p>
				<p>

					Aaaanyway, <a href="htty://zmyaro.com/projects/parodies/parody.html#googlewave.com!w+TNC8BHXrA" target="_blank">it is there</a>.  Enjoy.  Comment if you like it.  Comment if you do not.  Comment if you feel like commenting.  I will try to post again as soon as I have time.

			<title>Update: Better Organization</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2010-08-28,googlewave.com!w+aa4j93kEB</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					I mentioned <a href="news_static.html#2010-08-09,googlewave.com!w+i3jfPHc8A" target="_blank">a few weeks ago</a> that I was renaming my "My Stuff" section to "Projects".  I never quite finished making the change across my whole site, but as of today, I think I have fixed all the old links.  Also note that I am removing the "mystuff" folder because I am running low on free space.  And for the same reason, I may be switching where my website is hosted (feel free to comment with recommendations).
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, I have created a new section called "Me" to separate pages talking about me from pages talking about my creations.  It currently contains what used to be My Stuff > About Me and My Stuff > F.A.Q.
				</p>
				<p>
					Finally, I have added the navigation bar icons to more pages.  Up to this point I have gotten only positive feedback, so I guess it was a good change (and it certainly looks nicer than a plain list).

			<title>Update: Better Commenting</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2010-08-21,googlewave.com!w+1zWDQzUgF</link>
			<description>
				<img src="imgs/news/anony_comments.png" alt="Anony-Comments" style="float:right;"/>
				<p>
					In the past, commenting on my blog-like news feed has been limited to Google Wave users in browsers supported by Google Wave (Chrome, Safari, and Firefox).  Thanks to a <a href="http://antimatter15.com/wp/2010/06/wave-embed-api/" target="_blank">new tool</a> from antimatter15 <big style="font-weight:bold;">now anyone can comment from any<small>*</small> browser</big>.  When you click the "View static" link, comments will be displayed if available and you can post from there.  The UI is simple and should look familiar to long-time wave users.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, through use of antimatter15's Anony-Bot, you can comment even if you do not have a Google Wave account.  The only downside is that you will not get Wave's real-time communication.  If you want live typing and the ability to post from your wave account, just choose the "View as wave" option (formerly "View with comments").  Happy commenting!

					My site has been re-themed to look like Google Wave as part of my Save Google Wave work.  This also shows off how easy it is to use code from my <a href="projects/wave/ui.html" target="_blank">wave UI CSS</a> in another web site's stylesheet.

			<description>
				<p>
					In case you have not noticed, I am renaming the "My Stuff" section to "Projects".  URLs going to the mystuff folder will work for a little while until I update all the links to it, but after that I will only keep the installer and gadget XML for my Yes/No/Mini gadget, which some waves depend on.  With this "new" section comes new stuff!  And since I am still SaveGoogleWave-crazed, they are wave-related:
				</p>
				<p>
					The <a href="projects/wave/ui.html" target="_blank">first</a> has been up for a little over a day.  It is some CSS3 that offers a (I think) better alternative to wave.ui in gadgets and can also be used on other websites and web apps.  Feel free to link to the <a href="projects/wave/ui.css" target="_blank">stylesheet</a> or copy out what you need.  If you want to be nice, you can credit me for writing the CSS, but remember that the Google Wave team originally designed the UI.
				</p>
				<img src="projects/chrome/wave_reply.png" style="vertical-align:top; float:right;" alt="Wave Reply thumbnail"/>
				<p>
					The <a href="projects/chrome/index.html#wave_reply" target="_blank">second</a> is less for developers and more for users.  It is a bookmarklet that you can click when reading a message in Gmail to turn the message into a wave.

				I randomly decided to learn the wave gadgets and extension APIs.  My initial project, the time zone gadget is still being worked on, although you are certainly free to try it.  My other gadget is the <a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/waveref/googlewave.com/w+OnAgVLZkfT" target="_blank">Yes/No/Mini gadget</a>.  This one is just a miniature version of the Yes/No/Maybe gadget and as of about an hour and a half ago it was approved and added to the extensions gallery!  You can view all my wave extensions (with links to the installers, demo waves, and gadget XML) on <a href="projects/wave/index.html">this page</a>.  More will be coming when I have an idea, see a need, or get a request.

			<title>Observation: The Reason For The Nexus One?</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2010-07-14</link>
			<description>
				I, like many people, am seeing the Nexus One as a failure.  Google's web store failed, Google's plan to sell it through every carrier failed, and the phone did not even stay the top phone for very long.  I recently read a statement claiming that the point of the N1 was to drive innovation in Android phone hardware.  And when you think about it, within months the HTC Incredible and Evo were released and just recently the Droid X, all of which have 1 GHz processors, two of which have large screens and can take and output HD video, and all of which have overall better hardware than the N1 or iPhone 4.  Do I believe that this was Google's only motive or even its primary one?  Of course not, but at least the N1 did accomplish something.

			<title>Rant: My Responses To The Engi Update</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2010-07-13</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					I came back from Israel to find in my <i>Team Fortress 2</i> blog feed.that the Engineer Update had happened while I was gone (how convenient).  It had been several months since I last played TF2 and since Engi is my favorite class I figured this was a good time to start playing again.  I was somewhat surprised by the new UI, but I did not have any problems with it.  My only complaint is that I wish windows, like the server list and achievements list could be collapsed so I could reach the buttons behind them.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I actually started playing, I was surprised to discover that I had nothing big to complain about.  I still remember all the problems that occurred around the Sniper vs. Spy update, but it would seem that the random drop system has been made more fair, the backpack and crafting systems have had the major bugs fixed, and the new Engi items have been added (for the most part) without any major issues.  My congratulations to Valve for finally getting it right.
				</p>
				<p>
					One thing I particularly liked about this update was that it was for the Engineer--my favorite class, meaning a class I actually play, unlike the last few (soldier, demo, sniper).  And unlike those, I did not have to work toward specific achievements.  Things like upgrading and repairing teammates' buildings, resupplying their sentries, teleporting hundreds of people to the front lines, racing to buildings to remove sappers, and picking up old sentry and dispenser bits to use as building metal are all things I do anyway.  Which I suppose is what Valve had in mind.

				</p>
				<p>
					I was not particularly thrilled about the new items.  Not that they are not good choices, but they are not quite what <i>I</i> had hoped for.  The Frontier Justice seems useful in some cases, but more often then not it is an explosion that destroys my sentry the same explosion kills me as well.  The Gunslinger to me is useless.  I am certainly not willing to give up the power of a full level 3 sentry.  Although thre mini sentry seems eerily similar to the “Jiffy Gun,” which some other players and I discussed on the TF2 forums several months back, except that you only are allowed one mini-sentry.  The Wrangler is one I am somewhat uncertain about.  I like the idea of being able to control where my sentry aims (and being able to hit enemies shooting it from outside its normal range), but the delay in switching back to automatic aiming, the big laser beam and bright bubble calling attention to my sentry and the way I have seen some Engis chew through ammo and run out in the middle of a swarm is enough to keep me on the fence about the Wrangler.  But again, Valve wants there to be upsides and downsides to each weapon.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall I would consider this to be one of the most (if not the most) successful class update, and probably my favorite.

			<title>Rant: My Thoughts On The "Google Me" Rumor</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2010-06-29</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					For those who care, I am going to be away from home without my computer for a little while, so my site is not going to be updated for a little while.  On the bright side, this will not cause the end of the world.  Now on to the real post.
				</p>
				<p>
					Rumor has it Google intends to release a new social networking platform called "Google Me."  Here are some of my thoughts:
				</p>
				<p>
					A good part of my online life is run through Google.  I use Gmail, Google Talk, Google Calendar, Google Wave, Google Reader, Android, and of course Google search many times a day.  And then there is Facebook.  That one app that is different.  The app that looks different, works different, has its buttons in different places, and that I do not particularly like and only really use because of people who refuse to use anything else.
				</p>
				<p>
					I would personally love it if Google could make a Facebook-like app with a Googley simple interface and that integrates seamlessly with the other Google apps I use.  My Buzz and Reader shared items could be pulled in and shared with my Gmail/Gtalk/Gwave/Android contacts.  That would be great!
				</p>
				<p>
					One issue:
					<br/>
					They kinda already tried that.
				</p>

					A little app called Orkut.  An app that was supposed to be Google's social networking platform but was so unsuccessful that its name is not even built into Google's Android dictionary ("Facebook" is).  As nice as these "Google Me" rumors sound, I am wondering if Google is ready to challenge Facebook again.  If it does, it had better have something really good ready.

				I have added <a href="projects/faq.html" target="_blank">a page of questions</a> I am tired of answering.  In other news, I have made a <a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/waveref/googlewave.com/w+96gSZIgqH" target="_blank">wave version</a> of my news page.  Now you can follow my blog-like news feed via wave, RSS, or by checking the site regularly.  Finally, I have cleaned up my home page a bit by moving the subscription buttons to the news page.

			<title>Update: More Of My Stuff</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2010-06-08</link>
			<description>
				More content is being added to the <a href="projects/index.html">my stuff</a> section.  I recently added a page with two of my Chrome extensions (another one or two should be coming soon...ish).  In addition, today I added a page with some parodies I have written.  Congratulations, you now know I like to write parodies! +10 XP!  With this comes the completion of project 8779, which is...a parody!  Specifically one of a song that has been in my head since the J-Day theme (Harry Potter) was announced.  Sorry to non-TRSTYites who may not like it as much.

			<title>Update: News</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2010-05-05</link>
			<description>
				As you may have noticed, I have updated the news page.  It is now at <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">http://zmyaro.com/news.html</span><a href="https://zmyaro.com/blog">[EDIT] zmyaro.com/blog</a> (yes, three letters shorter!).  The posts are now listed by date and give you options to view them as plain HTML or in a wave with comments.  Not displaying every post on one page makes it easier to go through the list and makes it easier to read a single post.  The links in the RSS feed will now link to the HTML version since wave lags on some computers.  And speaking of waves, I have updated the wave view to work with the new embedding API.  This means that you can now view the comments in the wave <b>without logging into your wave account</b>.  Unfortunately right now the embedded wave is required to have a blue border and white background, so it does not blend in with the site like it used to, but hopefully Google will fix that soon.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				I know I say this every time, but I really do have other stuff I will post soon, but school and work take up a lot of time!

			<title>Update: MASSIVE Update</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2010-01-13</link>
			<description>
				Happy new year!  If you go to my home page, you will see that it has changed significantly.  The changes include:
				<ul>
					<li>
						New layout
					</li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The navigation box has moved to a navigation bar on the left.  This navigation bar can be minimized for people with smaller screens.
						</li>
						<li>
							There is now a sidebar to the right which, for the moment, contains my shared items from Google Reader and buttons related to my news feed.  I will probably add more things to it in the future.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<li>
						The navigation bar is now a bit more organized.  Links to parts of my site are organized alphabetically.  External links are sorted in an order I like :P
					</li>
					<li>
						I have finally added the "My Stuff" section.  Anyone who can read my mind/hacked my computer would know that I have been wanting to add this section for a while.  I was just not sure what to put in it.  Right now it contains a few apps I wrote, but other stuff will be coming soon (like within-a-week "soon", not my usual "soon").
					</li>
					<li>
						Comments on news posts are now viewable (but not yet editable) by non-wave users thanks to an awesome (and extremely fast) wave reader by Antimatter15.
					</li>
					<li>
						And on the code side of things
						<ul>
							<li>
								My home page has been updated to HTML5.  This does not mean much on the user interface side of things (yet), but things like the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tags help bots make more sense of the page.  Unfortunately this may cause a few problems for Internet Explorer users (IE is the only modern browser that does not support HTML5), but this can be solved with <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">Google Chrome Frame</a>.
							</li>
							<li>
								I am organizing my stylesheets better to make formatting more consistant across the site (exceptions include certain computer help and video game pages).
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
				I hope to bring some of the improvements (especially the navigation bar) to other parts of my site.  Please let me know what you think of the changes be e-mailing me at <a href="mailto:zmyaro@gmail.com">zmyaro@gmail.com</a> or waving me at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">zmyaro@googlewave.com</span>

			<title>Update: Scorp on Docs</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2009-12-02</link>
			<description>I finally got around to uploading the <a href="star_trek/scorp/index.html">Scorp dictionaries</a> to Google Docs.  Now you can view them online anywhere (assuming that "anywhere" has Internet).  Also, I am working on a larger update to the site in my free time.  Unfortunately I do not have much of that, so the update may not come as soon as I would like and might be released in smaller pieces rather than all at once.</description>

			<title>News: Comments</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2009-11-03</link>
			<description>
				Wow, three posts in one week.  I am on a roll here!  Anyway, I wanted to point out that I am testing a system for commenting on news posts.  You may remember when I tried putting all the news posts on a wave and that did not work very well.  I am trying a new system that will not have posts in waves, but will instead use waves for just the comments.  If you have a Google Wave preview (not dev preview this time), take a look <a href="oldnews-wave.html">here</a>.  Currently only the three most recent posts have commenting available.  In the future I may add comment waves to older posts if people request it.  Please note that you may not add bots or gadgets to these comment waves (unless approved by me).  Also, please do not say anything offensive in your comments.  I will edit/remove any inappropriate comments.  Finally, remember that this is just a test, so do not expect it to be perfect!

			<title>Observation: Droid Lies?</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2009-11-02</link>
			<description>I have been looking into the new Verizon Droid phone recently (mainly because of interest in the Android 2.0 OS)  while on the <a href="http://www.droiddoes.com">Droid website</a>, I happened to notice something.  Right there under the big "Turn-By-Turn Nav".  <a href="oldnews_imgs/droid_multi_touch.png">"Multi touch"</a>.  This is strange, because the Droid does <i>not</i> support multi-touch, so why would it be mentioned on the site?</description>

			<title>Observations: Companies' Responses To Windows 7</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2009-10-30</link>
			<description>
				The Windows 7 RC has been available for over seven months now, but people are just starting to modify their applications to take advantage of Windows 7's features.  Here are some I find particularly useful.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Google Chrome takes over the default title bar, but since reasonably early this year it has supported Aero Snap (allowing a window to be restored by dragging the title bar down when the window is maximized, and resizing it in various ways by dragging it to different edges of the screen).  It has even added similar features for tabs.  Also, a bit more recently Chrome has gotten its own custom jump list (the menu you see when you right-click a program on your taskbar) with the ability to open a new standard or incognito window or to open a commonly visited or recently closed page.  <a href="oldnews_imgs/chrome_win7_jump_list.png">[screenshot]</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						While iTunes is not my primary media player, I still have to use it to sync my iPod and occasionally play music from it when I am creating playlists for my iPod.  One day I did something I do all the time with Windows Media Player 12: I hovered over iTunes on the taskbar when I wanted to change the song.  To my surprise, I saw this: <a href="oldnews_imgs/itunes_win7_thumb_btns.png">[screenshot]</a>  It appears that iTunes 9 has the same thumbnail buttons as WMP12 as well as a jump list with options to open or search the iTunes store.  It does not, however, have WMP's "Play all music" or "Resume last playlist" options, nor does it have a list of frequently played songs/videos/playlists.  Unfortunately iTunes has yet to support Aero Snap properly.
					<br/>
					EDIT: iTunes now sort of supports Aero Snap.
					</li>
					<li>
						Steam just got updated a few days ago (finally) with decent support for Windows 7.  Valve may have waited until the last minute to do this, but they did a pretty nice job.  Steam now has a jump list that can quickly take you to a certain tab (Store, My Games, News, Community, or Friends), allow you to set your status (Online, Away, Busy, or Offline), or start a recently played game.  You can also pin games.  Here is a picture of it: <a href="oldnews_imgs/steam_win7_jump_list.png">[screenshot]</a>  One other feature that was added that I have not seen in any other program but Windows Explorer is having the taskbar icon double as a loading bar when you are downloading or updating a game <a href="oldnews_imgs/steam_win7_loading_bar.png">[screenshot]</a>  Unfortunately, Steam still has no support for Aero Snap.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<title>Apology + Update + Rant: I think I am missing something here...</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2009-10-20</link>
			<description>
				<b>2009-10-20:</b> Apology + Update + Rant: I Think I Am Missing Something Here...
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Sorry about not doing much here recently.  Been busy with other stuff (school, inProd, a little gaming if I ever have a free moment (which does not happen often thanks to the first two)).  I can tell you that at inProd, we are working on something really awesome.  I cannot give any details, but trust me, you are really going to like it.  I have also finished some nice updates to the <a href="http://inprod.co">inProd website</a> and my <a href="comp/school/math/index.html">math-on-computer tutorials</a> section (which I hope to expand at some point to general school-on-computer topics).
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Anyway, now that I have explained why I have not updated the site in so long, I thought I might rant for a little.  I actually have a few rants that I will hopefully post some time soon (assuming I have another few minutes of free time), but I decided put up this one since we are about two months (give or take depending on where you live) into the school year and are once again dealing with good, not-so-good, and just plain bad classes and teachers.  Please note that many of my rants are written so that there will be some disagreement.  I will try to put up pages for comments.  Unfortunately, this will only be open to Google Wave users.  Anyway, here we go...
				<br/>
				<br/>
				This is how school works: You ride a bus to a (relatively) big building.  You go to a room full of desks and chairs and learn information from a teacher.  At various points during the day, you might go to a different room, also filled with desks and chairs, and learn things from a different teacher.  After several hours of this, you leave the building, get on a bus again, and go home.  At least, that is how school os <i>supposed</i> to work.  How does school not follow that?  That minor detail of "...and learn information from a teacher."  For some reason, it seems like few teachers actually <i>teach</i>.  And of those who do, many of them show signs that seem to indicate that they do not do their jobs very well.  Let me explain by going through a few classes I am taking or have taken.

			<title>News: I will be away for a month</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2009-07-23</link>
			<description>Starting on 07-28-09, I will be away for almost a month without my computer and probably without Internet. This of course means that I will not be updating the website or responding to e-mails. The site, however, will still be up. Just wanted to let you know!</description>

			<title>Some random comments with a bit of news thrown in</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2009-07-21</link>
			<description>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Why is it that while sites like Google, Ask.com, and Wikipedia, as well as some other smaller, lesser-known sites have at minimum special pages to be viewed on mobile devices and in some cases, different buttons, images, and page formatting (and sometimes JavaScript) specifically designed for the iPhone and iPod touch, but Apple's website (the site belonging to the company that <i>made</i> the iPhone) is not designed at all for compatibility with the iPhone?
					</li>
					<li>
						Why is it that <i>The Journeyman Project: Turbo</i> and <i>The Journeyman Project 2: Buried In Time</i>, two games designed for Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, do not work on Windows XP but work on Windows 7 (RC) without compatibility mode?  Yes, this is true.  I discovered it today.  Please let me know if you know how to get either of these games to run on XP.
					</li>
				</ul>
				In other news, I plan to upload some stuff in the "Video Games" section of my site.  Please not that this has not been update for many months, but I figured that I might as well use the rest of my webspace (all nine megabytes of it).

			<title>News: arena_courtyard comes as a surprise</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2009-07-17</link>
			<description>A friend of mine created a map for <i>Team Fortress 2</i> (you may remember that I made one a few months ago and recently released an alpha version.  The interesting thing about his map is that he does not own TF2 and built the map in the <i>Portal</i> map editor.  After some--scratch that, a TON--of retexturing and some changes to accomodate the differences in size between Chell and the Heavy in the TF2 map editor on my PC, the map was somewhat playable.  We are now at alpha 5.1 and the map is looking pretty good.  We have not been able to test it on a "real" server (i.e. the best we have had is 1-on-11 over LAN) so we do not know how well the map plays, but it looks like it should work pretty well.  You can see its page on TF2maps.net &lt;http://forums.tf2maps.net/showthread.php?ltr=C&amp;t=8138&gt; or download older versions from <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/zmyaro/files">my Google Site</a>.  Enjoy!</description>

			<title>A review of the new <i>Harry Potter</i> movie</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2009-07-15</link>
			<description>I saw the new <i>Harry Potter</i> movie this morning (the only reason I woke up before noon).  These are my feelings about it.  I personally thought this was the worst of the books.  The main reason was that it seemed written just to be a movie, and not to be good <i>Harry Potter</i> story.  There was soo much focus on the relationships instead of whatever it is that makes the other books exciting.  Sadly, this was one of the few ways this movie stayed true to the book.  As someone who likes these sort of movies to be true to the books they are based on, I have had complaints about all the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies.  The exclusion of Snape's potion riddle in the first, the exclusion of the deathday party in the second, unnecessary changes in the third and fifth, confusing skips in the fourth, and the exclusion of Hogsmeade from the fifth (just to name a few).  The fourth would probably have been the best, except that it skipped too fast from event to event.  Oh, and that the maze was completely messed up.  Still, I think the first (and second) movie(s) did a great job of bringing the magical world of Harry Potter to life.  The third made a few changes, but was still overall quite good.  They started going downhill from there, though.  For whatever reason, someone at Warner Brothers has something against house elves (which should have been in, but were excluded from the fourth and sixth movies), characters having consistant hair length, and keeping a director.  The fifth almost brought the series back to the level of the third, but now David Yates (director of #5 and #6) has brought the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies back into their decline.  Honestly, I was hating this movie from almost the very start.  I was happy to see them showing the destruction of the bridge, as mentioned in the book (even if that scene seems to have replaced the chapter "The Other Minister"), but the whole train station part was completely random.  It was not in the book and personally I thought the book's version of Dumbledore picking up Harry was much better and funnier.  From the Slughorn scene on, it was good even if some things were changed around a little bit.  My only complaints from then until later were the interactions between Harry and Ginny, the lack of fire and other effects in the Unbreakable Vow scene (I expected the makers of the movie to be HAPPY to have a scene designed for effects like that), and the Borgin and Burkes scene.  Malfoy was supposed to go alone and look at the cabinet, not have some huge ceremony.  From then until later it was fine (except that it should have been Tonks who found Harry).  From then until Christmas, I have no comaplaints except that I would have like to see a scene with Snape teaching.  The Christmas scene, however, was completely messed up.  There was not supposed to be Death Eaters burning the Burrow!  Nor should there have been Harry chasing Bellatrix or Ginny chasing him!  There <i>was</i> supposed to be the Minister of Magic, but I guess they forgot about him (just like they forgot about chapter one).  Later on, I want to know why they added in the scene with Harry and Ginny in the Room of Requirement and removed Griffindor winning the quidditch cup.  Finally, the ending was somewhat disappointing.  The cave was okay (although the last part was overly dramatic), and the part on top of the tower was great, but the ending was FAIL.  They removed Dumbledore's funeral in exchange for people holding up their wands and lighting up the sky for a second?!<br/><br/>I agree with what I was told about the movie before I saw it: if you know nothing about the <i>Harry Potter</i> books and are just seeing it as a movie, then you will enjoy it.  If you are a fan of the series, you will not.<br/><br/>While I know this will probably not happen, I would like to see Chris Columbus (director of the first two movies) come back for the last one.</description>

			<title>News: Aaaaaaaand we are back!</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2009-07-15</link>
			<description>I just wanted to mention that I have updated the RSS feed and plan to resume updating it regularly.  In addition, there is now a page for <a href="oldnews.html">archived news</a>.  After being on my home page for a while or when a more important news post takes its place, a news post will be removed from my home page, however it will remain in the archive forever or until the file and its backups get corrupted or lost or I am forced to remove it from the server, whichever comes first.  In addition, the RSS feed will contain the previous two news posts as well (in case there are any of you on the Internet who only check the feed).</description>

			<title>News: Laptop home and TF2 map back online</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/blog/post.html#2009-07-10</link>
			<description>I got my laptop back and as promised I have uploaded my TF2 map (the link is below this paragraph).  Not only that, but the version number has gone up!  To test it, save the file to "C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\[yourUserName]\team fortress 2\tf\maps" (replace "Program Files" with "Program Files (x86)" if you have 64-bit) and it will show up under the map drop-down menu in the "Create Server" box in TF2.</description>

			<description>I do not have my laptop (I am borrowing someone else's computer to post this update), so I will not be uploading anything new for a little while.  Hopefully I will get around to uploading some (or hopefully all) of the video games section when I get it back.  The main update today (besides letting the Internet know I have not forgotten about my site) is putting a link to my <i>Portal</i> map pack!!!(the link is right below this paragraph)  On a semi-related note, my TF2 map is no longer on the server, but I will finish some improvements I have been making when I get my own laptop back and re-upload the map when that is done.  Umm...I think that is all for now.</description>
