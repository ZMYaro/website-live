			<title>Update: Outdated triangle tutorial</title>
			<link>https://zmyaro.com/comp/math/unicode_triangle</link>
			<description>
				<p>
					The most-searched tutorial on this site is still the one for inserting a triangle symbol in Microsoft Word, which has been outdated for ages, so that one, specifically, has received an update.  This does not mark the return of me writing math-on-computer tutorials, but I hope all the folks searching for help using triangle symbols in Word find it helpful!

			<title>Major Update: Another move and retheming</title>
			<link>http://zmyaro.com/comp/math</link>
			<description>
				<p>The site stopped being updated last year after Verizon cut off my FTP access (the way in which I accessed and updated the site's files).  If you have been following my <a href="http://zmyaro.com/blog">Blog-Like News Feed</a> or <a href="https://plus.google.com/114745581771396366390">Google+</a>, you know I have gradually been moving to hosting my site myself at <a href="http://zmyaro.com">zmyaro.com</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					As of today, the Math-On-Computer Tutorials site is now 100% live at <a href="http://zmyaro.com/comp/math">zmyaro.com/comp/math</a>.  In addition, I took the move as an opportunity to make some major updates to the site.  In addition to rejiggering some of the content and some code under-the-hood, the entire site has a new visual style more similar to the rest of my website.
				</p>
				<p>
					I hope you like these changes and look forward to bringing you new tutorials (*cough*GoogleDocs*cough*) in the relatively near future.
