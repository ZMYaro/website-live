				<p>
					This was my redesign for version 3 of the <a href="https://iodine.tjhsst.edu" target="_blank">TJ Intranet</a>.  This was the final of three different design directions, and the one we ultimately went with for the prototype.
				</p>
				<p>
					I3 had the requirement of keeping all the features Intranet2 (iodine) users were familiar with and depended on, but it made them available in an interface that felt more unified&mdash;still modular under the hood, but where I2 was visually boxes within boxes, I3 remove unnecessary borders to reduce the unnecessary visual weight, keep the focus on the content, and make the experience feel like one cohesive app.
				</p>

				<h2>General Intranet experience</h2>
				<p>
					This is not only conveyed through the UI, but in the user's experience as well, from the moment xe logs in, when xe is presented with the latest from the modules most students access most frequently, like calendar and 8<sup>th</sup> period, whereas I2 always started on the news module.
				</p>
				<div class="filmstrip">
					<a href="imgs/i2/news.png" target="_blank">
						<img src="imgs/i2/news_thumb.png" alt="The Intranet 2 interface has several intraboxes down the side for polls, directory search, file center, useful links, and birthdays.  The main box shows news.  The top right corner has links for news, preferences, suggestions, credits, help, and log out." />
					</a>
					<a href="imgs/i3_demo/home.png" target="_blank">
						<img src="imgs/i3_demo/home_thumb.png" alt="The Intranet 3 interface has a few intraboxes down the side, showing the time, weather, scratchpad, and useful links.  The home view shows a calendar for the week, and then columns for eighth period, latest news, and birthdays.  The top bar has links with icons and text labels for news, polls, eighth period, groups, events, preferences, and log out." />
					</a>
					<a href="imgs/i3_demo/home_android.png" target="_blank">
						<img src="imgs/i3_demo/home_android_thumb.png" alt="The Intranet 3 interface on an Android device hides the intraboxes, shows only the current day on the calendar, and the other home sections appear in one column below.  The top bar Intranet logo and links are only icons." />
					</a>
				</div>
				<p>
					Another UX change we agreed on was expanding the functionality of the navigation bar and deprioritizing intraboxes (left sidebar widgets).  The I2 top navigation did not, to put it mildly, prioritize the sections most used by TJ students, and instead, most of that was accessed through Intraboxes.  The largest problem with that was adding new intraboxes was done deep in preferences, but removing one was as simple as clicking the &ldquo;x&rdquo;, leading to a lot of new users deleting intraboxes and not knowing how to get to key places&mdash;in the above screenshot of I2, where the 8<sup>th</sup> period intrabox has been removed, how would you access that section, and ditto if you removed polls or search?
				</p>
				<p>
					The design I arrived at first did the obvious, making the most prominent links the most accessible.  Taking inspiration from Google's new top bar widgets, I proposed refactoring intraboxes for those key modules into pop-down panels that could be opened from any page, without navigating to the full module, and even on screens too small to fit intraboxes.
				</p>
				<div class="filmstrip">
					<a href="imgs/i3_mocks/intrabox_problems.png" target="_blank">
						<img src="imgs/i3_mocks/intrabox_problems_thumb.png" alt="A screenshot of Intranet 2 polls, eighth period, and search intraboxes have notes.  What happens if I delete one of these?  How can I get to a poll (without knowing the direct URL)?  How do I sign up for eighth or view activity rosters without a messy URL?  (iodine.tjhsst.edu/eighth/vcp_schedule/choose/uid/13181/bids/2188/start_date/2011-11-02).  How do I search the directory at all?  Most users can figure out what the X button does; not all know where to go to undo that action!" />

					<a href="imgs/i3_mocks/nav_intrabox_polls.png" target="_blank">
						<img src="imgs/i3_mocks/nav_intrabox_polls_thumb.png" alt="A panel pops down from polls on the top bar.  It lists unanswered polls and polls the user already responded to.  A note says this could be an alternative to intraboxes." />

						<img src="imgs/i3_mocks/nav_intrabox_cal_thumb.png" alt="A panel pops down from calendar on the top bar.  It lists upcoming events the user is attending and other events coming up soon." />
					</a>
				</div>
				<p>
					Of course, the Intranet experience actually starts with the log-in screen.  The I2 (and I1) log-in screen had, to put it mildly, a lot of empty space.  We initially discussed putting some useful information in the corner, such as the day's schedule or announcements, but ultimately, we decided the better option was to change the layout entirely.  We put the log-in form in a panel on the side, with the day's schedule in a panel next to it, and allowed additional panels to be added if needed for things like special alerts.  That design made better use of space, kept the layered panel design from the main Intranet that let users know how the panels would collapse if they shrunk the window, and still left room to keep the fun backgrounds from I2 <small>(and the Gnome 3 background I arbitrarily grabbed for testing)</small>.

				<h2>UI design</h2>
				<p>
					The design of UI elements was intended to straddle the minimalism of &ldquo;flat design&rdquo; that was rising in popularity at the time, while preserving the tactility of skeumorphic design that was still very popular, especially among touch screen users, who I2 was not designed to support.
				</p>
				<p>
					Controls like buttons and checkboxes were increased in size to be touch-friendlier than the browser defaults, and CSS gradients and shadows were used to give them a slight sense of physicality without being too visually heavy, and without requiring larger button images to be loaded.
				</p>
				<p>
					Text fields took some inspiration from the new Android 3.x design, with underlines that curved up to define their boundaries and differentiate them from divider lines, and slightly rounded corners to align with other elements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some form elements, such as multiple select boxes, did keep most of their browser default appearances, but at least incorporated the I3 border styles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unlike I2, the default I3 theme had a light and dark variant, and also aimed for slightly less harsh contrast in the default theme than I2's white/black/blue look.
				</p>
				<div class="filmstrip">
					<a href="imgs/i3_demo/elements_light.png" target="_blank">
						<img src="imgs/i3_demo/elements_light.png" alt="Intranet 3 form elements in the dark theme." />
					</a>
					<a href="imgs/i3_demo/elements_dark.png" target="_blank">
						<img src="imgs/i3_demo/elements_dark.png" alt="Intranet 3 form elements in the dark theme." />
					</a>
				</div>
				<p>
					The design also scales to any interface size without maintaining multiple codebases&mdash;like the proposed native Android app&mdash;and without losing functionality on smaller screens.  CSS media queries allow the browser to alter the layout, showing multiple panes on larger screens, a more condensed two-pane layout on tablet-size devices, and one pane at a time on phone-size screens.  CSS transitions smoothly animate the changing elements when resizing a window on a larger screen.
				</p>
				<p>
					The focus on breaking down workflows into multiple panes not only makes it easier to separate screens on mobile devices, but also improves the user experience on larger screens&mdash;the selective use of shadows separates panes less obtrusively while creating a clearer visual hierarchy than I2's array of flat boxes that makes clear the current section and how panes will collapse if the user shrinks the windows.
				</p>
				<div class="filmstrip">
					<a href="imgs/i3_mocks/scaling.png">
						<img src="imgs/i3_mocks/scaling_thumb.png" alt="A mock-up shows on a small screen, two successive steps are shown on separate screens; on a medium screen, they are still on separate screens, but intraboxes are present on the left sidebar, and on a large screen, the steps are shown in panes side by side, with intraboxes still on the left." />

					<a href="imgs/i3_demo/prefs_phone.png" target="_blank">
						<img src="imgs/i3_demo/prefs_phone_thumb.png" alt="A phone sized screen shows news preferences, with a button to step up one level.  The top bar and Intranet logo are collapsed to icons, and the search bar spans the screen below them." />

						<img src="imgs/i3_demo/prefs_tablet_thumb.png" alt="A tablet sized screen shows the preferences section on the left side, with news selected, and news preferences on the right side.

						<img src="imgs/i3_demo/prefs_laptop_thumb.png" alt="A laptop sized screen has space for the intraboxes on the left, with the full Intranet logo above them.  The main section has the preferences section, with news selected, and news preferences covering it on the right side.

					</a>
					<a href="imgs/i3_demo/prefs_desktop.png" target="_blank">
						<img src="imgs/i3_demo/prefs_desktop_thumb.png" alt="A desktop or TV sized screen has space for the intraboxes on the left, with the full Intranet logo above them.

					</a>
				</div>
				<p>
					With intraboxes no longer vital to navigation, and just being widgets users wanted available, I could make them stop being so visually heavy.  Intrabox names were removed entirely, only appearing when tapped or hovered over.  They did appear lightly when collapsed, since the user could not tell which was which otherwise, but even that was a substantial improvement over I2's boxes.

				<h2>Other changes</h2>
				<p>
					In addition to the sweeping changes affecting the entire I3 experience, we also made some notable changes to individual modules.  Among others, we redesigned the eighth period list from a simple selection list to a rich, informative, and useful one.  The groups module already existed in I2, but it was only used under-the-hood to restrict the audience of news posts, polls, and activities, and admins had to manually add users to groups.  Our proposed new groups module would expose that to users, allowing them to filter group-specific content, see what other groups are available, and manually join and leave non-moderated groups on their own.  The calendar module was another that existed in I2, but it was never completed, and events ended up fragmented between the 8<sup>th</sup> period module and a calendar app separate from I2; our calendar module sought to unify all those.

				<h2>No waiting</h2>
				<p>
					While I3 was in development*, parts of this design were made made available in I2, including light and dark &ldquo;i3&rdquo; themes that brought some amount of &ldquo;responsive design&rdquo;, where possible, as well as parts of the redesigned login page, more useful links being added to the top bar, directory search being added to the top, and redesigned 8<sup>th</sup> period list being implemented (massive thank you to Dylan Ladwig for leading design and implementation of the latter).  Those updates improved the I2 user experience a fair amount, especially on mobile devices, though they of course could not add things like I3's multi-pane layouts, universal search, or new modules.
