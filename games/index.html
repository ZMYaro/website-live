						<p>
							A 2D side-scrolling platformer in which the player controls a camp counselor as he fights an alien invasion to save the camp.  The game features a variety of levels, enemies, and power-ups based on things around the camp.  In additon, a rhythm game based on popular camp songs was designed, but never implemented.
						</p>
						<p>
							This game was created as a joke because of the status that counselor had at the camp (comparable Chuck Norris jokes on the Internet).  I am not linking to the game, posting screenshots, or posting his full name out of respect for his privacy.

				<h2 style="text-align: center;">Video Games - Designed, but Not Built</h2>
				<ul class="col2 big">
					<li>
						<h2>The Legend Of Zelda: Maestro Of Color</h2>
						<p>
							<i>The Legend Of Zelda: Maestro Of Color</i> is a 3D <i>Zelda</i> game set in the <i>Wind Waker</i> timeline around a hundred years after the events of WW.  The land of Hyrule somewhat resembles its layout in <i>Ocarina Of Time</i>, but certain parts changed as a result of the great flood.  In MOC, Link discovers a dark force is draining the color from Hyrule and sets off on a quest to destroy the evil character behind it.
						</p>
						<p>
							MOC was originally designed with the Nintendo DS in mind, but the 3DS's improved graphics capabilities make it a better target device.  It primarily uses the touch sceren to enhance the standard 3D <i>Zelda</i> controls rather than replacing them, as <i>Phantom Hourglass</i> and <i>Spirit Tracks</i> did.
						</p>
						<p>
							My work on MOC began around 2007, so PH and ST did not influence the initial game (nor did <i>Skyward Sword</i> or the 3DS port of OOT).  Most of the influence came from OOT, MM, WW, TP, and the original TLOZ.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Double Smash Bros.</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Double Smash Bros.</i> was an attempt to combine the two-player team idea from <i>Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</i> to the <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> series.  It was created with a next-generation Nintendo DS in mind (it was designed before the 3DS existed).
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to the fighting pairs, DSB introduced a variety of new items, characters, and a new game mode that used SSB trophies in a game that I have been told resembles the <i>Fire Emblem</i> games (I am not familiar enough with the <i>Fire Emblem</i> series to say for sure).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Super Mario Sunshine 2</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Super Mario Sunshine 2</i> was originally designed by my friend Jamie Fox-Canning to be a sequel to <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>.  When he dropped the project, he agreed to let me take over working on it.  Among other things, I created a lot of concept graphics, a couple new levels, refined the new nozzle designs, and redesigned the controls for the Wii (his original concept was designed for the GameCube).
						</p>
						<p>
							SMS2 begins with Shadow Mario hitching a ride with Mario and co. back to the Mushroom Kingdom along with some stolen shine sprites.  He proceeds to skatter the shines across the Mushroom Kingdom and surrounding areas and start causing trouble in Mushroom City.
						</p>
						<p>
							Gameplay is similar to SMS1, but with a few additions.  Mushroom City serves as the central hub from which Mario can access other levels.  Most levels are completed with a combination of platforming and using FLUDD.  Some moves from <i>Super Mario 64</i> that were removed in SMS1 are back now, such as crouching, backflipping (without FLUDD), and long jumping (without sliding).
						</p>
						<p>
							FLUDD also has some new abilities in SMS2, which the player can unlock once he or she discovers Professor E. Gadd's lab in Mushroom City.  New nozzles, such as the Pressure Nozzle, offer new ways of traveling, unlocking secrets, and defeating enemies.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h2>Gadd Party</h2>
						<p>
							<i>Gadd Party</i> is a game designed for a hypothetical DS successor (it was designed before the 3DS existed) featuring Mario, Luigi, Bowser Jr., Petey Piranha, and Professor E. Gadd.  An unknown enemy has attacked Professor Gadd's main lab, so he has recruited his inventions (and their current owners) to assist him (Petey was causing trouble with Bowser Jr. and happened to get caught up in the mix).  The player must use all four characters' and their Gaddgets' abilities to complete a variety of challenges, restore power to Gadd's main lab, and take down the villain.
						</p>
						<p>
							Gameplay is similar to most 3D Mario games at a basic level with some elements added from <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>, <i>Luigi's Mansion</i>, and some third-person shooters.  Gadd's main lab serves as the central hub where the player can switch characters, save his or her progress, and unlock new levels.  Most levels (within the context of the story) are other Gadd labs or other areas Gadd has links to (including virtual realities of Gadd's creation).
						</p>
						<p>
							<i>Gadd Party</i>, to some extent, builds on the charater-switching mechanic in <i>Super Mario 64 DS</i>, but goes much further with it by giving the playable characters and their Gaddgets much more varied abilities and, in some cases, opportunities to work together.  In addition, the story actually acknowledges the distrust that would exist and interactions that would likely occur between the characters given their histories with each other (whereas Mario, Luigi, and Wario barely acknowledged each other in SM64DS).
