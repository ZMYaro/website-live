							A 2D side-scrolling platformer in which the player controls a camp counselor as he fights an alien invasion to save the camp.  The game features a variety of levels, enemies, and power-ups based on things around the camp.  In additon, a rhythm game based on popular camp songs was designed, but never implemented.
						</p>
						<p>
							This game was created as a joke because of the status that counselor had at the camp (comparable Chuck Norris jokes on the Internet).  I am not linking to the game, posting screenshots, or posting his full name out of respect for his privacy.

				<h2>Video Games - Designed, but Not Built</h2>
				<ul class="col2 projLinks">
					<li>
						<h3 class="title">The Legend Of Zelda: Maestro Of Color</h3>
						<p>
							<i>The Legend Of Zelda: Maestro Of Color</i> is a 3D <i>Zelda</i> game set in the <i>Wind Waker</i> timeline long after the events of WW.  The land of Hyrule roughly resembles its layout in <i>Ocarina Of Time</i> and <i>Twilight Princess</i>, but certain parts drastically changed as a result of being under the great flood for so long.  In MOC, Link discovers a dark force is draining the color from Hyrule, and the king set him on a quest to destroy the evil entity behind it.
						</p>
						<p>
							MOC was originally designed with the Nintendo DS's input capabilities in mind, but it envisioned primarily using the touch screen to enhance the standard 3D <i>Zelda</i> controls, rather than replacing them as <i>Phantom Hourglass</i> and <i>Spirit Tracks</i> did.
						</p>
						<p>
							My work on MOC began around 2007, so PH and ST did not influence the initial game (nor did <i>Skyward Sword</i> or the 3DS Zelda remakes).  Most of the influence came from TLOZ1, OOT, MM, WW, and TP.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="title">Double Smash Bros.</h3>
						<p>
							<i>Double Smash Bros.</i> was an attempt to envision a combination of the two-player team idea from <i>Mario Kart: Double Dash!!</i> and the <i>Super Smash Bros.</i> series.  It was initially created with a hypothetical Nintendo DS successor in mind (before the existence or specifics of the 3DS were announced).
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to the fighting pair mechanic, DSB introduced new items and characters that would work well with the mechanic.  It also included a new game mode that used SSB trophies in a story mode that mixed Smash Bros. and turn-based strategy mechanics.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="title">Super Mario Sunshine 2</h3>
						<p>
							A design for a hypothetical sequel to <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i> was originally proposed by my friend Jamie Fox-Canning, and he allowed me to contribute to the project.  Among other things, I created a lot of concept graphics, a couple new levels, refined the new nozzle designs, and redesigned the controls for the Wii Remote and Nunchuk (his original concept was designed for the GameCube, or any other generic gamepad).
						</p>
						<p>
							SMS2 would begin with Shadow Mario hitching a ride with Mario and co. back to the Mushroom Kingdom after one of their trips to Isle Delfino, along with some stolen shine sprites.  He would proceed to scatter the shines across the Mushroom Kingdom and surrounding areas and get the attention of authorities in Mushroom City.
						</p>
						<p>
							Gameplay would be similar to SMS1, but with a few additions.  Mushroom City would serve as the central hub, and most levels would be completed with a combination of platforming and puzzle solving, using F.L.U.D.D.  Some moves from <i>Super Mario 64</i> that were removed in SMS1 would return, and F.L.U.D.D. would have new abilities, unlockable through Professor E. Gadd's lab in Mushroom City, including alternate offensive nozzles, and nozzles that work with new types of puzzles.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 class="title">Gadd Party</h3>
						<p>
							<i>Gadd Party</i> is a game designed for a hypothetical DS successor (before the existence or specifics of the 3DS were announced) featuring Mario, Luigi, Bowser Jr., Petey Piranha, and Professor E. Gadd.  An unknown enemy has attacked Professor Gadd's main lab, so he has recruited his inventions (and their current owners) to assist him (Petey was causing trouble with Bowser Jr. and happened to get caught up in the mix).  The player must use all four characters' and their Gaddgets' abilities to complete a variety of challenges, restore power to Gadd's main lab, and take down the villain.
						</p>
						<p>
							Gameplay would be similar to most 3D Mario games at a basic level with some elements added from <i>Super Mario Sunshine</i>, <i>Luigi's Mansion</i>, and some third-person shooters.  Gadd's main lab would serve as the central hub where the player can switch characters, save xer progress, and unlock new levels and abilities.  Most levels (within the context of the story) are other Gadd labs or other areas Gadd has links to (including virtual realities of Gadd's creation).
						</p>
						<p>
							The game, to some extent, builds on character-switching mechanics from past Nintendo games, such as <i>Super Mario 64 DS</i> and <i>Donkey Kong 64</i>, but aims to give the characters more varied play styles, through their own base weights and move sets, as well as their Gaddgets' abilities.  In addition, the story and game progression would play off the distrust and interactions between the characters given their histories (as opposed to Mario, Luigi, and Wario barely acknowledging each other in SM64DS).
