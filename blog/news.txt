	<h1>Concerns Regarding &ldquo;The Snowmen&rdquo;</h1>
	<small>2012-12-10</small>
</header>
<p>
	I am concerned about the <i>Doctor Who</i> Christmas special, &ldquo;The Snowmen.&rdquo;  I am afraid it will suffer from the same problems as &ldquo;The Wedding Of River Song&rdquo;<small> (s6ep13)</small>.  That is, it will try to cram too much into a single one-part episode and end up feeling rushed or incomplete.
</p>
<p>
	Consider the number of things this episode is going to have happen (in no particular order):
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The effect the loss of the Ponds has had on The Doctor needs to be shown</li>
	<li>The Doctor will be convinced to come out of retirement.</li>
	<li>The TARDIS will regenerate.</li>
	<li>The new companion, Clara, will be introduced.</li>
	<li>The characters Madame Vastra, Jenny, and Strax will be fleshed out more than in &ldquo;A Good Man Goes To War&rdquo;<small> (s6ep7)</small>.</li>
	<li>The new villain, Doctor Simeon, will be introduced.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Okay, so introducing a one-episode villain is not a big deal, but the TARDIS regenerating and the introduction of Clara are kind of big.  Also, time needs to be dedicated to showing The Doctor's state after losing the ponds.  Episodes like &ldquo;A Town Called Mercy&rdquo;<small> (s7ep3)</small> were intended to show how The Doctor's companions were part of his moral compass.  &ldquo;The Snowmen&rdquo; needs to show how The Doctor has changed without them.

	<h1>A Theory About Trenzalore</h1>
	<small>2012-12-06</small>
</header>
<p>
	Brilliant new <i>Doctor Who</i> theory Jamie and I came up with:
</p>
<p>
	Just before the events at the fields of Trenzalore, The Doctor tells Melody his name and then erases than information from his memory. That way, when the question is asked and he cannot speak falsely or fail to answer, he can honestly say he does not know. Afterward, Melody is there to reshare his memories. That explains both how he is able to make it through the fields of Trenzalore and how Melody knows his name.
</p>
<p>
	Additional point added by Jamie: What if The Doctor actually erases all knowledge of who he is (possibly through Melody or with the pocket watch thing from s3). That way, when he gets to the fields of Trenzalore, he is told he is The Doctor and responds, &ldquo;Doctor Who?&rdquo;

	<h1>Rant: I Want You To Take My Money, But You Want Me To Want To Keep It - Part 1: Nintendo</h1>
	<small>2012-11-23</small>
</header>
<p>
	Thanksgiving is over, so the time for holiday shopping has officially begun.  This has, of course, made me think about what sort of things <i>I</i> want this year.  However, thinking through the companies whose products I normally drool over, I am realizing they must want me to keep my money this year.
</p>
<p>
	First off, Nintendo.  Anyone who knows me probably knows I am quite a Nintendo fanboy, and have been for years.  In 2006, I drooled over the Wii and drove from store to store for months until I finally got one.  When I heard Nintendo was working on a successor to the Wii, I was excited...until I saw what it was.  The Wii was revolutionary, but the Wii U seems to fall short in all possible ways.  And now I shall complain about them in no particular order.
</p>
<p>
	My first complaint is that, Nintendo has been bragging about the Wii U's graphics...and ignoring the fact that the Xbox 360 was capable of comparable graphics <i>before the Wii came out</i>!  Nintendo has never been known for being the best at graphics or processing power, but it also never tried to brag when it knew it was behind.  Now it is bragging that its next-gen console has current-gen graphics.
</p>
<p>
	Next, Miiverse, Nintendo's new gaming-oriented social network, will probably fail about as badly as Apple's music-oriented social network, &ldquo;Ping.&rdquo;  At best, people might visit Miiverse occasionally with questions, but it is unlikely most users will check for Miiverse posts as frequently as Facebook, Google+, or Twitter.  Also, when did &ldquo;Yeah&rdquo; become a verb?
</p>
<p>
	Another complaint is the fact that the Wii Menu exists at all on the Wii U.  This is the same as one of my big complaints about Windows 8: If your new OS is so great, why is your old OS hacked onto it?  The Wii was able to play GameCube games pretty seamlessly.  Why is Wii U backward compatibility such a mess?
</p>
<p>
	Maybe it would help if Nintendo actually had some decent sort of account system to sync games from Wii's to Wii U's (and maybe DSi's to 3DSes).  I am a Club Nintendo member, and my Wii Shop Channel account is linked to my Club Nintendo membership.  Why not have Club Nintendo, Miiverse, my Nintendo eShop purchases, and maybe even all that friend code nonsense be synced with one central account?  How can Nintendo expect people to trust its online gaming, social networking, or digital download offerings if it gives no evidence it cares about having a reliable backend.  I trust that when I buy a game from the Google Play Store or the Windows Store, that purchase is saved to my Google/Microsoft account and can be accessed from any Android/Windows 8 device I sign into, should the download fail or my original device break.  When I buy a game from the Wii Shop Channel/Nintendo eShop, I trust that that game will be on that console at that time and nothing more.  If anything happens to my Wii, I have no idea if I will get that game back.  Similarly, if I want to play a game online from an Xbox or Windows 8 device, I just need to exchange gamer tags, which are, again, linked to Microsoft accounts.  If my Wii breaks, I have to exchange Wii numbers and friend codes for every friend and every game.  I have no idea who thought that up, but he or she clearly does not understand UX.
</p>
<p style="font-size: smaller;">
	(I should mention, a lot of that is hypothetical.  I am not an Xbox or Windows 8 fan.  That said, the way those situations <i>would</i> play out is accurate.)
</p>
<p>
	One small penultimate complaint is about Nintendo TVii.  My main disappointment there, apart from the fact that the feature was not available at launch, is that the Wii U's only awesome feature is not even related to gaming.  In addition, the fact that it even lagged in the promo video greatly lowers my expectations.
</p>
<p>
	My last complaint is about the Wii U GamePad.  I will admit I found the idea of bringing the touch screen idea from the DS to console gaming kind of clever.  But, compared to something like Xbox SmartGlass, Nintendo's idea seems terrible.  Sure, there will likely be some awesome experiences that result from the combination of a controller and a touch screen, but there are so many situations where the GamePad will cause problems.
</p>
<p>
	Example #1: Someone makes a game that uses the GamePad for something.  Three of your friends come over to play multiplayer.  The Wii U only supports two GamePads at a time.  What do?
</p>
<p>
	Example #2: You are playing a game online using the Pro Controller.  You want to voice chat with the other players.  The headset must be plugged into the GamePad, not the Pro Controller or the Wii U console.  o_O
</p>
<p>
	Example #3: Every first-person shooter that could be made more awesome with the Wii Remote's precision will now be required to drop that in favor of some sort of touch screen gimmick.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, there is the issue of making every Wii U owner buy a Nintendo Wii U GamePad if he or she wants another.  Compare that to SmartGlass where just about any mobile device (my Galaxy Nexus, my dad's IdeaPad, my friend's Surface, my girlfriend's dad's iPad, etc.) can be that second screen.  Oh, and this second screen has multi-touch.  As one friend of mine likes to put it, &ldquo;You are never finished buying a Nintendo product.&rdquo;  This has never been more true than with the Wii U, which is technically not complete without four Wii Remotes, four Wii Nunchuks, a Wii Balance Board, two Wii U GamePads, and four Wii U Pro Controllers (plus, optionally, four Wii Classic Controllers or Classic Controller Pros).
</p>
<p>
	I feel like I probably will buy a Wii U at some point just to play <i>New Super Mario Bros. U</i>, <i>ZombiU</i>, and <i>Nintendoland</i>, but, at this point, the Wii U is nothing but a box of disappointments.  And a slate of disappointments.  And another controller.  And Wii Remotes.  And some other controllers.  All the controllers.
</p>
<p>
	(Also, yes, I realize I got off Wii U-specific complaints into general Nintendo complaints, but I suppose the complaints about Nintendo's online offerings also cover why I never bought a 3DS or DSi.)

	<h1>AndRant: A Tablet Is Not A Giant Phone</h1>
	<small>2012-11-22</small>
</header>
<p>
	<aside data-side="right">
		<a href="../imgs/blog/2012/11/22/giant_iphone.png" target="_blank"><img src="../imgs/blog/2012/11/22/giant_iphone.png" alt="The &ldquo;giant iphone&rdquo; complaint seen in a Motorola Xoom ad" /></a>
	</aside>
	When the iPad came out, the complaint that it was basically a giant iPhone was so common the Motorola Xoom quoted it in its commercials.  When Android tablets first came out, I appreciated that the Android team recognized the potential those larger devices had to provide different experiences.  Everything from the launcher, to e-mail clients, to the calendar, to the contacts list, to chat, to the Android Market, to the settings app got redesigned to take advantage of the increased screen space.  When Android 4.0 was released, a few changes were made to make it easier for one OS to work on phone- and tablet-size devices, but tablets still got an experience optimized for that screen size.
</p>
<p>
	With Android 4.2, however, Google seems determined to backtrack toward the pre-3.0 days when Android tablets essentially had scaled-up phone layouts.  That is most apparent in the system bar being split between the status bar and navigation bar, but it is also apparent in the redesigned tablet launcher.
</p>
<p>
	<aside data-size="right">
		<a href="../imgs/blog/2012/11/22/thumb_zones_good.png" target="_blank"><img src="../imgs/blog/2012/11/22/thumb_zones_good.png" alt="The Motorola Xoom, with its thumb-reachable zones highlighted" /></a>
		<br />
		<a href="../imgs/blog/2012/11/22/thumb_zones_bad.png" target="_blank"><img src="../imgs/blog/2012/11/22/thumb_zones_bad.png" alt="The Nexus 10, with its thumb-reachable zones highlighted" /></a>
	</aside>
	This trend is problematic not only because does not take full advantage of the available screen space to display more information, but also because the new UI is simply less convenient to use.  The system bar design introduced in Android 3.0 put notifications and system controls in the bottom corners of the screen, where they were most easily reachable by the user's thumbs when the user gripped the edge of the tablet.  In 4.2, the home, back, and recents buttons are displayed in the center of the screen, where they are not easily reachable, and the notifications and quick settings panel must be pulled down from the top of the screen.
</p>
<p>
	The Android team says the decision was made to increase consistency between different versions of Android, but while the consistency probably helps shrink the Android codebase, applying the Android phone UI to tablets ignores the fact that these larger, more powerful devices are capable of providing different and greater experiences, just as full PCs are.
</p>
<p>
	The UI I see Android 4.2 for tablets being &ldquo;consistent&rdquo; with, apart from Android for phones, is Notification Center on the iPad, which went the same route of simply copying the iPhone's Notification Center UI.  While Apple and Google copying each other is nothing new, I find this unfortunate because the Android 3.0 layout was more reminiscent of a Windows PC&mdash;a device associated with productivity as well as entertainment.  Copying the iPad's interface suggests Google wants to reduce Android tablets to being what iPads are: devices primarily intended for content consumption.

	<h1>&ldquo;The Angels Take Manhattan&rdquo; Predictions</h1>
	<small>2012-09-28</small>
</header>
<p>
	Tomorrow will be the Ponds' last episode.  I wanted to throw out some last-minute predictions.  First though, some things that have been confirmed:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>It will be set in Manhattan (duh).</li>
	<li>Amy will be trying to save Rory.</li>
	<li>Melody Pond/River Song will appear.</li>
	<li>The Weeping Angels will return to their old habit of sending people back in time (as in &ldquo;Blink&rdquo; (s3)) instead of breaking necks (as in &ldquo;Time Of Angels&rdquo; (s5)).</li>
	<li>They (presumably the Angels) are coming for Rory (according to The Doctor).</li>
	<li>One or more people will witness his/her/their own future(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, my predictions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If The Statue Of Liberty is an Angel, I totally called it.</li>
	<li>The combination of Angels sending people back in time and Amy, Rory, and Melody being there makes me think they might reference one of the last couple times Melody was in New York (possibly when she was there with The Silence as a child - see &ldquo;The Impossible Astronaut&rdquo;/&ldquo;Day Of The Moon&rdquo; (s6)).</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Time Of Angels&rdquo; (s5) confirmed the Angels can &ldquo;infect&rdquo; people by looking people in their eyes.  I think this is going to happen to Rory.</li>
	<li>Amy is supposed to have a huge fear of the Weeping Angels (they were apparently her worst fear, according to &ldquo;The God Complex&rdquo; (s6)).  It is not usually referenced, but it may become important here.</li>
	<li>Rory always escapes death, so maybe he actually dies here.  Or maybe, because we would expect that to happen, Amy dies here.  Or maybe, since the first image for s6 set us up to expect that, Rory dies here.  Or maybe, since the trailer shows The Doctor telling Rory &ldquo;they're coming for you,&rdquo; they set us up to expect <i>Rory</i> to die, and <i>Amy</i> dies.  Or maybe they both get zapped back to 1969 and get to raise little Melody and live happily ever after apart from the whole stuck-back-in-time thing.  I do not know.</li>
</ul>

	<h1>Random Doctor Who Predictions</h1>
	<small>2012-09-13</small>
</header>
<h3>1:</h3>
<p>
	It is not exactly normal for The Doctor to switch back and forth between traveling on his own and traveling with his primary companion(s), as he is with Amy and Rory in season 7 (though I agree it <i>is</i> justifiable in this case).  What if all or part of season 7's episodes and/or <i>Pond Life</i> take place in The Doctor's timeline after &ldquo;Angels Take Manhattan&rdquo;?  It would certainly explain The Doctor's sadness in the last episode of <i>Pond Life</i> if he were trying to have adventures with the Ponds while knowing what will happen to them.
</p>
<h3>2:</h3>
<p>
	Another (incompatible) theory: The Ponds' departure is supposed to be final, but nothing stops him from visiting Amy and Rory earlier in their timelines (like he did Rose at the end of &ldquo;The End Of Time&rdquo;).  What if the Ponds' departure in &ldquo;Angels Take Manhattan&rdquo; involves letting one or both Ponds survive, but prevents The Doctor from seeing them again (like Donna)?
</p>

	<h1>Responses To Asylum Of The Daleks</h1>
	<small>2012-09-02</small>
</header>
<p>
	Last year, after each episode of <i>Doctor Who</i>, I updated a wave with my latest comments and predictions.  That worked very well because wave was a great platform for letting me maintain that list <i>and</i> letting other people comment on what I said.  Since that is not really an option this year, I have decided to just put my comments in blog posts.  If you want to comment, you should do so on the Google+ where I link to the blog post (until I decide how I want to rewrite commenting into my blog, since Google broke my previous wave-based system).
</p>
<p>
	&ldquo;Asylum Of The Daleks&rdquo; was a great way to start the series...for the most part.  I will start with the things I did like, make a smooth-ish transition to my complaints, and end with my predictions.  Oh, and I will talk a bit about &ldquo;Pond Life&rdquo; (the prequel mini-series) as well.
</p>
<h2>SPOILERS FOLLOW.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</h2>
<p>
	The episode starts off pretty well.  Seeing Skaro was kind of neat (despite potential continuity issues), and introducing a new type of Dalek-in-a-human was a surprising twist.  I enjoyed asylum itself largely because, having seen some old <i>Who</i>, I recognized some of the old Daleks.  I also liked how the episode made the Daleks seem like much more than mindless killing machines&mdash;both through the Daleks talking about having a concept of beauty, as well as things like Amy seeing other Daleks as regular people when viewing them from a Dalek's perspective.  Even though I predicted Oswin would be a Dalek from early on&mdash;though I was expecting another puppet, and I think the episode was written so I would expect that&mdash;I still really enjoyed not only the idea of a human in a Dalek shell, but also the ideas about what a person&mdash;or possibly any being&mdash;would perceive when put in a Dalek shell like that.  Finally, the ending.  I think a lot of fun things could result from this ending.  On one hand, the Daleks will no longer want to kill The Doctor, but, on the other hand, they no longer have the fear and respect(?) for him that they previously had.  Think about how many times The Doctor has stopped his enemies just with his reputation (e.g., &ldquo;The Pandorica Opens,&rdquo; (s5) &ldquo;Silence In The Library&rdquo; (s4)).
</p>
<p>
	The episode is not without its problems, however, and I do not mean Moffat trickiness (though there is that too).  I will start with &ldquo;Pond Life.&rdquo;  I liked the first four episodes of the mini-series.  Sure, they were short, but they were fun and silly.  The last episode turns sad out of nowhere.  I had no idea when this was taking place; initially I thought it was after &ldquo;The Angels Take Manhattan&rdquo; and The Doctor was trying to pretend Amy and Rory were still there but then it showed Amy kicking Rory out and I got really confused.  I tried to give the series the benefit of the doubt, though, and waited for &ldquo;Asylum Of The Daleks.&rdquo;  Unfortunately, it did not help.  If &ldquo;Pond Life&rdquo; were all supposed to be a direct prologue to s7ep1, it would have made sense to have all five episodes lead to the divorce, not have it just suddenly appear.  It got worse when they explained <i>why</i> they got divorced.  Given how Amy and Rory were portrayed in the past, they seem like a couple that could handle not being able to have more children (have they never heard of adoption?), not just jump to divorce.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, predictions.  I think the Amy/Rory situation is pretty much resolved because it was only supposed to be important for one scene.  What is not resolved, however, is Oswin.  While two actresses who played companions <i>did</i> show up in episodes as different characters (Freema Agyeman/Martha Jones as Adeola Oshodi in &ldquo;Army of Ghosts&rdquo; (s2) and Karen Gillan/Amy Pond as a soothsayer in &ldquo;The Fires of Pompeii&rdquo; (s4)), I do not think this is such a case.  It was known that Jenna-Louise Coleman was going to be the new companion long before &ldquo;Asylum Of The Daleks&rdquo; was finished.  Assuming Oswin is the new companion, I am concerned this is going to be another River Song-type story.  That is, The Doctor will meet her earlier in her life and travel with her while knowing how she will die.  You could argue that Oswin did not know The Doctor in &ldquo;Asylum,&rqduo; but I think she is good enough to be able to lie to The Doctor.  The whole &ldquo;remember me&rdquo; thing at the end definitely made me think she at least knew who she was.  This would be kind of annoying, but not surprising as Moffat has a history of reusing his storylines (Amelia's situation in &lqduo;The Eleventh Hour&rdquo; (s5) was about the same as Reinette's in &ldquo;The Girl In The Fireplaec&rdquo; (s2)).
</p>
<p>
	There is another interesting theory I have heard: Oswin was &ldquo;assimilated&rdquo; (to use the <i>Star Trek</i> term) by the Daleks and had access to the hive mind of all the Daleks, not just the ones in the asylum.  Therefore it is reasonable to conclude the Daleks have complete access to her mind as well.  It is possible the Daleks may create a copy of Oswin (we have had no shortage of clones in recent <i>Who</i> history--nearly every companion in new <i>Who</i> has had some sort of duplicate made*).  That duplicate could either be part of a Dalek plan from which The Doctor rescues her, or she could be set up to meet The Doctor as <i>part</i> of a Dalek plan.  In the latter case, since the Daleks have joined other residents of the universe in asking, &ldquo;Doctor Who,&rdquo; it is possible that Oswin might be part of a plan that leads The Doctor to the fields of Trenzalore.
</p>

	<h1>AndRant: Google Music For Jelly Bean</h1>
	<small>2012-07-18</small>
</header>
<p>
	You may remember I ranted a bit about my experience with the leaked pre-release version of Google Music.  Since then a lot has changed in the app, and today Google released the &ldquo;harder, better, faster, stronger&rdquo; (according to the update news) Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean/JB) version of Google Music for Android (still compatible with pre-JB devices, of course).  A lot has changed since the 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich/ICS) version; in fact, in terms of functionality, this might be the most major change to the Android music experience since the Music app became Google Music.  This is good in some ways and annoying in other ways.  I have actually been using the app for a couple weeks (since Google I/O day), and these are my impressions.
</p>
<p>
	<aside data-side="right">
		<a href="../imgs/blog/2012/07/18/widget.png" target="_blank"><img src="../imgs/blog/2012/07/18/widget.png" alt="The new Google Music home screen widget" /></a>
	</aside>
	Let us start with the good.  I have used the Music home screen widget since I first started using my old Droid a couple years ago, and this is the first major change it has seen on phones.  In addition to the current song and artist names, play/pause button, and next song button, the widget now includes album art and a thumbs up button.  I would personally prefer a rewind/previous song button over the thumbs up button, but I still think the updated widget is a fantastic improvement.
</p>
<p style="clear:right;">
	<aside data-side="left">
		<a href="../imgs/blog/2012/07/18/recent.png" target="_blank"><img src="../imgs/blog/2012/07/18/recent.png" alt="The new recent music page, with the new playlist art, bottom action bar, and navigation header pointed out" /></a>
	</aside>
	The UI of the app itself has also seen some improvements.  While the old bottom action bar design minimized the space taken up by action bars, the new look maintains consistency across views and device types.  The addition of a top action bar on phones means the bottom action bar can now contain music controls&mdash;a feature that was removed in the ICS version to make room for the search and action overflow buttons.  Unfortunately, this UI change removed the tabs that used to occupy the top of the portrait UI in favor of using swipe gestures to switch pages.  What is irritating is, unlike the phone landscape or tablet UIs, there is no drop down list of pages, so getting from one page to another can take up to five swipes where it used to take a single tab press.  Hopefully that will be improved in a later update.
</p>
<p>
	Another improvement is the new recent music page.  In landscape mode on phones and in both orientations on tablets, it shows a 3D carosel of albums and playlists, but in portrait orientation on phones it used to show a simple list.  Now, instead, the portrait view contains large album and playlist images.  And on that note, playlist images are now made up of album art from the songs they contain&mdash;a major improvement.
</p>
<p style="clear:right;">
	<aside data-side="right">
		<img src="../imgs/blog/2012/07/18/honeycomb.png" alt="Song/album/artist names on Google Music for Android 3.x" />
	</aside>
	Another change (note that I do not refer to this one as an &ldquo;improvement&rdquo;) is to the Now Playing screen.  There are certainly improvements here.  For instance, additional controls fade in without needing to resize the album art (which was an annoyingly laggy animation on older devices).  But those improvements are overshadowed by lost functionality.  Since the first Music app in Android 1, it has been possible to long-press a song, album, or artist name to search for it on the web or in other apps like YouTube, Pandora, etc.  The first Google Music app (seen on an Android 3.x (Honeycomb) device in the screenshot) improved on this by letting you add a song to a playlist, view the whole album, or view all your albums by the artist, by tapping the song, album, or artist, respectively.  Finally, every version of the app since Android 1 has let you slide a song/album/artist name horizontally to see the rest of it if it is too long to fit on the screen.  This latest update removes all those features and, in most cases, offers no alternative ways to perform those actions.  There is only one reason I can think of for this change, which is it makes the UI more similar to the iPhone/iPod Touch music app, with basic controls at the bottom, big album art in the middle, seek/shuffle/repeat hidden by default, back button at the upper-left, and queue button at the upper-right.
<p>
	That brings me to the most major change in this update: Google has brought back the now playing queue.  Surprisingly, I do not approve.  I say surprisingly because when the Android Music app becaume Google Music, it removed the now playing queue, and that was one of my biggest complaints.  There are two reasons I am not happy to see it return.
</p>
<p>
	The first is that, as of ICS, the Google Music app was doing fine without it.  Sure, it was unpleasant on the first Google Music app for Android 2.3 (Gingerbread), but when ICS came along and standardized the &ldquo;up&rdquo; button as a means of navigation, everything got simpler.  If you started playing a song from an album, pressing the Google Music icon at the upper-left of the now playing screen would take you to that album.  If you started playing a song from a playlist, pressing the icon would take you to the playlist and scroll you to that song.  Updating that playlist meant updating the current queue.  In the new version of Google Music, pressing the Google Music icon from the now playing screen takes you back to the recent music screen, and if you add a song to the playlist you started from, you have to add it to the queue separately.
</p>
<p>
	The second reason I am not happy to see the now playing queue return is that it is buggy and unpredictable.  For instance, let us say you tapped a song in an album earlier in the day.  The app automatically added the rest of the album to the queue.  That makes sense.  Now, hours later, you select a song from a playlist.  That playlist gets added to the queue, <em>but the album you listened to earlier is still there</em>.  If you do not make a habit of clearing your queue before playing a new playlist, it can become a mess.
</p>
<p>
	This gets worse when you bring shuffle into the picture.  Let us say you have nothing in your queue and you select the first song in an album.  The album should start playing and, assuming shuffle is off, the rest of the album should be in the queue, in order.
	<br />
	<aside>
		<a href="../imgs/blog/2012/07/18/shuffle_bug1.png" target="_blank"><img src="../imgs/blog/2012/07/18/shuffle_bug1.png" /></a>
	</aside>
	<br />
	Now you decide to enable shuffle.  Rather than the app moving to a random point in the queue when the song changes, as it has in every previous version of Music, it randomizes the order of items in the queue.  Not quite what I am used to, but acceptable.
	<br />
	<aside>
		<a href="../imgs/blog/2012/07/18/shuffle_bug2.png" target="_blank"><img src="../imgs/blog/2012/07/18/shuffle_bug2.png" /></a>
	</aside>
	<br />
	Here is where things get strange.  If you then disable shuffle, the queue remains randomized rather than returning to its original order.
	<br />
	<aside>
		<a href="../imgs/blog/2012/07/18/shuffle_bug3.png" target="_blank"><img src="../imgs/blog/2012/07/18/shuffle_bug3.png" /></a>
	</aside>
	<br />
	Combine that with the fact that selecting an item in a different album or playlist adds the whole playlist to the queue, and you can imagine how weird it can get to have parts of the queue shuffled and parts unshuffled (even more so when tracks get added by selecting Menu &rarr; Shuffle all on an album or playlist).
</p>
<p>
	So there you have it.  The latest version of Google Music for Android brings, among other things, some highly-requested features (including better playlist images), UI changes (updated home screen widget, consistent top action bar, music controls on bottom action bar, new Now Playing screen), and the return of the now playing queue.  If you have an Android 2.2+ device, go ahead and download the latest version from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.music" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

I am fine, as are my friends (the car I drove home from the storm in...slightly less so...), but we were without electricity and running water for several days.  Thankfully, unlike snowmageddon a couple years ago, we could actually drive out.  Anyway, now, only a few days after Amazon, my downtime has ended.

	I finally did what I should have done long ago: bought a domain (thankfully zmyaro.com is not something anyone else would want to buy), set up a server and just hosted my site myself.  The downside is that means my site being up is dependent on me having working power (now that I have acknowledged that, prepare for record-breaking storms) and Internet, but the positive side is that I control everything, meaning I can build on top of whatever backend I want rather than being limited to static files (ugh).  To start, I am planning to rewrite my blog in PHP, which I expect to take several months (well, no, it will take a couple hours or days at most, but it will be interrupted by things like my job, social life, and other projects).  Eventually I am thinking of rewriting the whole site in NodeJS, but that will probably not happen for a while.  So...yeah, that is the state of things wrt my website.
</p>
<p>
	Oh, and for those who care about such things, the server is running Apache on Arch Linux.  [EDIT] The server is no longer on Arch.

	<b>2011-01-17</b> Review: <i>Inception</i>, second viewing
</p>
<p>
	When I first saw <i>Inception</i>, I thought it was awesome, but was not worth seeing more than once.  I discovered yesterday that I was definitely wrong.  Obviously a little bit of the fun is lost when you know what is going to happen instead of trying to figure out who is in whose dream.  But there is so much in the movie that I still found myself noticing plenty of things that I missed before or forgot about, and it is difficult to not still be impressed by the attention to detail in the huge dream worlds.  Even if you already saw <i>Inception</i>, I highly recommend renting the DVD/Blu-Ray.
</p>
<p>
	Here are some of the things I learned from watching <i>Inception</i>:
	<ul>
		<li>Zombies in your head can be just as bad as zombies in your house</li>
		<li>Out-of-control existentialism causes problems</li>
		<li>Christopher Nolan is a genius</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	<b>My rating:</b>
	<br/>
	Story: 5/7
	<br/>
	<span style="margin-left:18px; display:inline-block;">
		The overall story was good, but many of the characters lacked depth

	<b>2011-01-02</b> Review: <i>Tron Legacy</i>
</p>
<p>
	Warning: Spoilers Ahead!
</p>
<p>
	When I first heard that Disney was making a <i>Tron</i> sequel, I was kind of expecting it to be bad.  I liked <i>Tron</i> more for it's geek value than its story and <i>Legacy</i> looked like the same thing with more lights and less plot.  That is exactly what it is.  That is not to say the movie is overall worthless, but it is more for your ears and eyes than for your brain*.
</p>
<p>
	The movie begins with Kevin Flynn explaining to his son pretty much everything that happened inside the computer in the original <i>Tron</i>, minus anything about the MCP.  He leaves out everything that happened in the real world though, so anyone who has not seen the first movie will have no idea who Alan or Dillinger are, nor will they recognize the laser that transported Flynn into the computer.  Clu (Clu 2, the villain of <i>Legacy</i>) is mentioned, but Clu 1 is not mentioned, leaving people who have not seen the first movie with no idea why that name is important or why Clu's lights are yellow instead of red.  One other thing from the opening scene I found interesting was that a <i>Tron</i> poster was on the wall in Sam Flynn's room, but <i>Tron</i> was being advertised as a game, even though Tron is a security program.
</p>
<p>
	After the opening, the film skips almost thirty years to get to the present.  The beginning of that scene is the first indicator of the main reason to see the movie: it is the first time you really hear Daft Punk's awesome soundtrack playing alongside movie action.  When I said this movie was for your ears and eyes, it was no accident that I put ears first.  Having Daft Punk do the soundtrack was a brilliant decision, and the visuals on the Grid go perfectly with the music.  One of my favorite parts of the movie was seeing the new light cycle grid for the first time in IMAX 3D while &lduqo;The Game Has Changed&rdquo; blasted from huge speakers (like I said, this movie is for your ears and eyes, and you owe it to those senses to experience this movie with the biggest possible speakers and screen).  Really, in my opinion, the best parts of the movie were those in the games and city.  The re-imaginings of the disc and light cycle battles are incredible (not to mention you get to see 3D slo-mo close-ups of both).  Unfortunately the scenes in the outlands (i.e. the parts not bright and shiny) were not as impressive.  Except for a few funny lines, those parts are, frankly, pretty boring.  They are mostly for story development, but since the plot barely exists, story development scenes felt kind of flat.  Either they should have been refined or (preferably) the rest of the story should have been good enough to make them seem worth the time.
</p>
<p>
	On the subject of the characters, I think most of the main characters were played reasonably well (although Sam's level of stupidity seemed to vary strangely, from hacker genius, to idiot, to normal, to above normal), but Kevin Flynn and Clu 2 were definitely the best.  Both are played by Jeff Bridges (double Bridges all the way across the Grid!), the former played normally and the latter through CG anti-aging magic.  Bridges does a great job at playing the two characters.  The way Flynn talks and acts is an excellent combination of his personality from the first movie plus the 30 * [grid time slow factor] years he has been on the grid.  Clu is also played excellently, seeming like a great villain with just a little bit of his creator showing through.  Another character I liked was Kaster, the program who runs the End Of Line Club.  His crazy personality was very fun and [actor name here] did a great job playing the character.
</p>
<p>
	Now for all my complaints.  First a quick one regarding Clu and Tron's anti-aging CG magic (both are played by the same actors as in the original <i>Tron</i> thirty years ago).  That was incredible.  I honestly thought when I saw Flynn in he opening scene that they had found a younger actor who looked similar enough to Jeff Bridges (and same for Tron in the flahbacks).  It was only when I saw Clu that I realized it was not a human.  Having said how amazing the CG is, I did feel like Clu slipped to the edge of the uncanny valley** at times.  There were a few cases where different parts of the face did not match up (e.g. shouting with an angry mouth, but sad-looking eyes and eyebrows).
</p>
<p>
	Other complaints I have are mainly about inconsistencies with the first movie.  One big one is the costumes.  The original costumes were meant to look like circuits, and light would flow down the lines like energy through a computer.  In <i>Legacy</i>, the lights are just lights.  The lights are just random stripes that do not resemble much of anything (except Tron's distinctive “T” shape, copied from the first movie).  A similar complaint I have is the look of the world.  The original <i>Tron</i>'s world really seemed computer-like, with flowing memory streams and gray surfaces that seemed clearly artificial.  In <i>Legacy</i>, the city seems like a normal city with an unusually high number of neon lights.  Other places like Kevin's hideout and the End Of Line club seem like they were designed with the idea of &ldquo;if we build a normal set and make the floor light up, it is automatically Tron.&rdquo;  Another example: instead of feeling like a video game, the game grids (and several other areas) look and sound like they are just made out of plastic.  The atmosphere also feels wrong.  I would expect thunderstorms under the MCP's rule maybe, but certainly not in Clu's “perfect” system.  And the whole thing looks unnecessarily dark.  Even the outlands and sea of simulation in the original <i>Tron</i> were bright and full of shapes and colors, but in <i>Legacy</i> the Grid is a constant cloudy dark and stormy night.
</p>
<p>
	My final and largest complaint is the story.  I have already said that this is not a movie to go see for it's story, but I feel like after having had thirty years to work on it it could have been a little bit better!  The basic idea is good: <span class="spoiler">Clu gets Sam into the computer expecting Sam to find his dad and try to get him out, allowing Clu to get the superuser's disc, which will give him the ability to control the way out, allowing his army to invade the real world.</span>.  One of the problems with how he story turned out is that someone decided that the movie had to have some moral, <span class="spoiler">in this case it is partially about perfection being unachievable and partially about valuing family</span>, but that just served to corrupt a potentially decent story.  And the best message I saw the movie sending was “programs will do EXACTLY what you tell them, so be careful when you code.” (which is a good lesson, but not the one trying to be taught).  I am glad though that no one tried to create a romance between Sam and Quorra (or any other female-looking program).  But minimized fails do not make a great story.  There were still too many holes, including these: <span class="spoiler">Why do users arrive at the arcade but leave from a “portal” far away?  Why did every program have to be written if Flynn can clone users?  Why do users not have the power to create and destroy things that they had in the first movie?  Why was Sam transported into the Grid with no lights while Kevin arrives with lights?  If lights are put on programs when they are being prepared for games, why do non-gaming programs have them?  And my biggest one: if merging Flynn and Clu was so destructive, then how do computers not explode when someone does an svn/git/hg merge?</span>
</p>
<p>
	Overall, see this movie for incredible sound ad awesome visuals, or for the geek value, or maybe for Jeff Bridges, but not for the story.  But if you can, see it in 3D on the largest possible screen with the largest possible speakers.  Your senses will thank you and, if you can ignore part that cares about what is actually going on in the plot, your mind will be blown.
</p>
<small>
	*Yes, I know the brain plays as much a role in hearing and seeing as the eyes and ears.  I just meant this movie is not intended to receive much serious thought.
	<br/>
	**The uncanny valley refers to a point where the CG  is only slightly less than realistic but people, for some reason, do not like it.  Any more or less realistic than the uncanny valley will be extremely well-received.

<p>
	First off, I want to make it clear that this post contains no <i>Portal</i> references, despite the title.  Okay, on to the post.
</p>
<p>
	I realize that I have not been posting much on the site recently.  The main reason for this is school, but I also have several other projects that have taken priority over my site.

I actually just got home last night from visiting my mother's family.  I know a ton of people are going to ask if I got the &ldquo;enhanced pat-down&rdquo;.  Actually going through security was possibly the easiest it has ever been since TSA insanity started.  This was the case for both my flight leaving and coming back.  I do have one complaint however.  I happened to see the touch-screen controls for the X-ray scanner and they looked like Windows 3.  With how much those machines probably cost, is a pretty UI too much to ask?

<p>
	<b>2010-10-13</b> Rant: Another Facebook Observation
</p>
<p>
	I have already talked plenty about how Facebook gets success from the idea that if &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; is doing something then you should too.  But there is another factor I have noticed.  That factor is the way things are worded.
</p>
<p>
	One of the most common actions on Facebook is to &ldquo;like&rdquo; something.  In the Google world (Buzz, Reader, PicasaWeb, etc.), to &ldquo;like&rdquo; something just indicates what you think it would—that you liked it.  You found it humorous or interesting or for some other reason approved of it and want to show that.  In the Facebook world &ldquo;like&rdquo; can mean that in the case of liking somebody's status message, but when you like a page, it is more comparable to following a Buzz or Twitter feed.  But no one would choose to &ldquo;follow&rdquo; a sentence he or she likes.  How many less likes would there be if users instead had to click &ldquo;receive regurlar messages from [page name] in your news feed&rdquo;?
</p>
<p>
Another verb (sadly)* used a lot on Facebook is &ldquo;friend&rdquo;.  Becoming someone's friend on Facebook does two main things:  It makes the person's status messages and shared items show up in your news feed (again, similar to following a person on Buzz or Twitter) and it allows you to see when the person is online and chat with him or her (similar to approving a chat invite in Google Talk, Skype, or many other IM programs, or having each other as contacts in Google Wave).  As I have indicated in my parenthetical statements, neither of these are unique to Facebook.  The difference is the words it uses.  If you are friends with someone in real life, you feel obligated to accept a Facebook friend request.  On the other hand, you would feel no pressure to follow the person's Buzz or Twitter.  Nor would you feel compelled to add him or her to your Wave contacts (unless perhaps for convenience).  Once again the difference is that becoming &ldquo;friends&rdquo; with someone makes you feel like you should accept more so than &ldquo;receive regular messages from [person] in your news feed&rdquo; or &ldquo;become mutual contacts with [person].&rdquo;
</p>
The Facebook idea of &ldquo;friends&rdquo; is one part of the Facebook system I have a problem with because there is easy no way for someone to see your posts without also having access to your personal information (unless you do not put up any information at all, which then blocks out people who <i>should</i> be allowed to view it).  Google deals with this nicely by simply separating Buzz followers, the people allowed to see your personal information, and your chat contacts.  Google's system also eliminates the issue of people who are not really your friends, but who you still want to allow access to your posts, IM with, and/or exchange information with.  But while <i>I</i> can see through the words Facebook uses, sadly most of the Internet apparently cannot.
</p>
<p style="font-size:smaller;">
	*An English teacher dies every time &ldquo;friend&rdquo; is used as a verb.

	<b>2010-09-06</b> Update + Ramble: School!
</p>
<p>
	I am returning to school tomorrow.  On one hand I am excited to go back because it is so awesome (please do not kill me, antimatter15), but on the other hand I still have things I meant to do this summer that I never finished.  Oh well.
</p>
<p>
	On a related note, going to school means I will only have one computer (and by &ldquo;computer&rdquo; I mean laptop or bigger; Droids do not count) with me.  So my old broken Windows laptop will not be coming with me to school.  This of course means that I need Linux and Windows on the same computer.  So I just had a fun time this weekend cleaning off my hard drive (which I discovered is 20 GB smaller than it is advertised to be) and reinstalling OSes.  Twice.  Fun fun fun.  But now everything works better than before.  Also funny thing: it took over an hour to install Windows and a long time (I do not remember exactly) to install the 70 or so updates, but it only took under 15 minutes to install Linux and less than that to install the >250 updates.  And before you say it, Sreenath, shut up.
</p>
<p>
	On another note related related to the start of school, I began writing a parody back in June (it was actually while I was in Israel, so if anyone from the trip saw me typing on my Droid, I might have been working on this).  I had intended to finish it in time for the start of school, but I still have lyrics I have not come up with.  It is yet another AVPM parody (I really need to find another source XD), and another &ldquo;Get Back To Hogwarts&rdquo; parody, except this time I have parodied essentially the entire scene.
</p>
<p>
	Aaanyway, like I said it still is not done, but I have a good chunk done (although not all polished), so I am going to put it out.  Kind of like the &ldquo;Get Back To TJ&rdquo; canary build.  And a funny thing is I bet none of my friends who have seen AVPM get what I mean by canary build.
</p>
<p>
	Aaaanyway, <a href="projects/parodies/parody.html#googlewave.com!w+TNC8BHXrA" target="_blank">it is there</a>.  Enjoy.  Comment if you like it.  Comment if you do not.  Comment if you feel like commenting.  I will try to post again as soon as I have time.

<p>
	I mentioned <a href="news_static.html#2010-08-09,googlewave.com!w+i3jfPHc8A" target="_blank">a few weeks ago</a> that I was renaming my &ldquo;My Stuff&rdquo; section to &ldquo;Projects&rdquo;.  I never quite finished making the change across my whole site, but as of today, I think I have fixed all the old links.  Also note that I am removing the &ldquo;mystuff&rdquo; folder because I am running low on free space.  And for the same reason, I may be switching where my website is hosted (feel free to comment with recommendations).
</p>
<p>
	Also, I have created a new section called &ldquo;Me&rdquo; to separate pages talking about me from pages talking about my creations.  It currently contains what used to be My Stuff > About Me and My Stuff > F.A.Q.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, I have added the navigation bar icons to more pages.  Up to this point I have gotten only positive feedback, so I guess it was a good change (and it certainly looks nicer than a plain list).

Thanks to a <a href="http://antimatter15.com/wp/2010/06/wave-embed-api/" target="_blank">new tool</a> from antimatter15 <big style="font-weight:bold;">now anyone can comment from any<small>*</small> browser</big>.  When you click the &ldquo;View static&rdquo; link, comments will be displayed if available and you can post from there.  The UI is simple and should look familiar to long-time wave users.
</p>
<p>
	In addition, through use of antimatter15's Anony-Bot, you can comment even if you do not have a Google Wave account.  The only downside is that you will not get Wave's real-time communication.  If you want live typing and the ability to post from your wave account, just choose the &ldquo;View as wave&rdquo; option (formerly &ldquo;View with comments&rdquo;).  Happy commenting!

	<b>2010-08-15</b> Update: My Site, Re-Themed (Save Wave, Part 4)
</p>
<p>
	My site has been re-themed to look like Google Wave as part of my Save Google Wave work.  This also shows off how easy it is to use code from my <a href="projects/wave/ui.html" target="_blank">wave UI CSS</a> in another web site's stylesheet.

	<b>2010-08-09</b> More Projects!  (A.K.A. Save Wave, Part 3)
</p>
<p>
	In case you have not noticed, I am renaming the "My Stuff" section to "Projects".  URLs going to the mystuff folder will work for a little while until I update all the links to it, but after that I will only keep the installer and gadget XML for my Yes/No/Mini gadget, which some waves depend on.  With this &ldquo;new&rdquo; section comes new stuff!  And since I am still SaveGoogleWave-crazed, they are wave-related:
</p>
<p>
	The <a href="projects/wave/ui.html" target="_blank">first</a> has been up for a little over a day.  It is some CSS3 that offers a (I think) better alternative to wave.ui in gadgets and can also be used on other websites and web apps.  Feel free to link to the <a href="projects/wave/ui.css" target="_blank">stylesheet</a> or copy out what you need.  If you want to be nice, you can credit me for writing the CSS, but remember that the Google Wave team originally designed the UI.
</p>
<aside data-side="right">

</aside>
<p>
	The <a href="projects/chrome/index.html#wave_reply" target="_blank">second</a> is less for developers and more for users.  It is a bookmarklet that you can click when reading a message in Gmail to turn the message into a wave.

	<b>2010-07-14</b> Observation: The Reason For The Nexus One?
</p>
<p>
	I, like many people, am seeing the Nexus One as a failure.  Google's web store failed, Google's plan to sell it through every carrier failed, and the phone did not even stay the top phone for very long.  I recently read a statement claiming that the point of the N1 was to drive innovation in Android phone hardware.  And when you think about it, within months the HTC Incredible and Evo were released and just recently the Droid X, all of which have 1 GHz processors, two of which have large screens and can take and output HD video, and all of which have overall better hardware than the N1 or iPhone 4.  Do I believe that this was Google's only motive or even its primary one?  Of course not, but at least the N1 did accomplish something.

<p>
	<b>2010-07-13</b> Rant: My Responses To The Engi Update
</p>
<p>
	I came back from Israel to find in my <i>Team Fortress 2</i> blog feed.that the Engineer Update had happened while I was gone (how convenient).  It had been several months since I last played TF2 and since Engi is my favorite class I figured this was a good time to start playing again.  I was somewhat surprised by the new UI, but I did not have any problems with it.  My only complaint is that I wish windows, like the server list and achievements list could be collapsed so I could reach the buttons behind them.
</p>
<p>
	When I actually started playing, I was surprised to discover that I had nothing big to complain about.  I still remember all the problems that occurred around the Sniper vs. Spy update, but it would seem that the random drop system has been made more fair, the backpack and crafting systems have had the major bugs fixed, and the new Engi items have been added (for the most part) without any major issues.  My congratulations to Valve for finally getting it right.
</p>
<p>
	One thing I particularly liked about this update was that it was for the Engineer--my favorite class, meaning a class I actually play, unlike the last few (soldier, demo, sniper).  And unlike those, I did not have to work toward specific achievements.  Things like upgrading and repairing teammates' buildings, resupplying their sentries, teleporting hundreds of people to the front lines, racing to buildings to remove sappers, and picking up old sentry and dispenser bits to use as building metal are all things I do anyway.  Which I suppose is what Valve had in mind.
</p>
<p>
	I was not particularly thrilled about the new items.  Not that they are not good choices, but they are not quite what <i>I</i> had hoped for.  The Frontier Justice seems useful in some cases, but more often then not it is an explosion that destroys my sentry the same explosion kills me as well.  The Gunslinger to me is useless.  I am certainly not willing to give up the power of a full level 3 sentry.  Although thre mini sentry seems eerily similar to the &ldquo;Jiffy Gun,&rdquo; which some other players and I discussed on the TF2 forums several months back, except that you only are allowed one mini-sentry.  The Wrangler is one I am somewhat uncertain about.  I like the idea of being able to control where my sentry aims (and being able to hit enemies shooting it from outside its normal range), but the delay in switching back to automatic aiming, the big laser beam and bright bubble calling attention to my sentry and the way I have seen some Engis chew through ammo and run out in the middle of a swarm is enough to keep me on the fence about the Wrangler.  But again, Valve wants there to be upsides and downsides to each weapon.
</p>
<p>
	Overall I would consider this to be one of the most (if not the most) successful class update, and probably my favorite.

			<b>2010-06-29</b> Rant: My Thoughts On The &ldquo;Google Me&rdquo; Rumor

		</p>
		<p>
			For those who care, I am going to be away from home without my computer for a little while, so my site is not going to be updated for a little while.  On the bright side, this will not cause the end of the world.  Now on to the real post.
		</p>
		<p>
			Rumor has it Google intends to release a new social networking platform called &ldquo;Google Me.&rdquo;  Here are some of my thoughts:
		</p>
		<p>
			A good part of my online life is run through Google.  I use Gmail, Google Talk, Google Calendar, Google Wave, Google Reader, Android, and of course Google search many times a day.  And then there is Facebook.  That one app that is different.  The app that looks different, works different, has its buttons in different places, and that I do not particularly like and only really use because of people who refuse to use anything else.
		</p>
		<p>
			I would personally love it if Google could make a Facebook-like app with a Googley simple interface and that integrates seamlessly with the other Google apps I use.  My Buzz and Reader shared items could be pulled in and shared with my Gmail/Gtalk/Gwave/Android contacts.  That would be great!
		</p>
		<p>
			One issue:
			<br/>
			They kinda already tried that.
		</p>
		<p>
			A little app called Orkut.  An app that was supposed to be Google's social networking platform but was so unsuccessful that its name is not even built into Google's Android dictionary (&ldquo;Facebook&rdquo; is).  As nice as these &ldquo;Google Me&rdquo; rumors sound, I am wondering if Google is ready to challenge Facebook again.  If it does, it had better have something really good ready.

In other news, I have made a <a href="https://wave.google.com/wave/waveref/googlewave.com/w+96gSZIgqH" target="_blank">wave version</a> of my news page.  Now you can follow my blog-like news feed via wave, RSS, or by checking the site regularly.  Finally, I have cleaned up my home page a bit by moving the subscription buttons to the news page.

			<b>2010-06-08</b> Update: More Of My Stuff
			<br/>
			<br/>
			More content is being added to the <a href="projects/index.html">my stuff</a> section.  I recently added a page with two of my Chrome extensions (another one or two should be coming soon...ish).  In addition, today I added a page with some parodies I have written.  Congratulations, you now know I like to write parodies! +10 XP!  With this comes the completion of project 8779, which is...a parody!  Specifically one of a song that has been in my head since the J-Day theme (Harry Potter) was announced.  Sorry to non-TRSTYites who may not like it as much.

			<b>2010-05-05</b> Update: News
			<br/>
			<br/>
			As you may have noticed, I have updated the news page.  It is now at <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">http://mysite.verizon.net/zmyaro/news.html</span> EDIT: <a href="http://zmyaro.com/blog">zmyaro.com/blog</a> (yes, three letters shorter!).  The posts are now listed by date and give you options to view them as plain HTML or in a wave with comments.  Not displaying every post on one page makes it easier to go through the list and makes it easier to read a single post.  The links in the RSS feed will now link to the HTML version since wave lags on some computers.  And speaking of waves, I have updated the wave view to work with the new embedding API.  This means that you can now view the comments in the wave <b>without logging into your wave account</b>.  Unfortunately right now the embedded wave is required to have a blue border and white background, so it does not blend in with the site like it used to, but hopefully Google will fix that soon.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			I know I say this every time, but I really do have other stuff I will post soon, but school and work take up a lot of time!

			<b>2010-01-13</b> Update: MASSIVE Update
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Happy new year!  If you go to my home page, you will see that it has changed significantly.  The changes include:
			<ul>
				<li>
					New layout
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The navigation box has moved to a navigation bar on the left.  This navigation bar can be minimized for people with smaller screens.
					</li>
					<li>
						There is now a sidebar to the right which, for the moment, contains my shared items from Google Reader and buttons related to my news feed.  I will probably add more things to it in the future.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<li>
					The navigation bar is now a bit more organized.  Links to parts of my site are organized alphabetically.  External links are sorted in an order I like :P
				</li>
				<li>
					I have finally added the "My Stuff" section.  Anyone who can read my mind/hacked my computer would know that I have been wanting to add this section for a while.  I was just not sure what to put in it.  Right now it contains a few apps I wrote, but other stuff will be coming soon (like within-a-week "soon", not my usual "soon").
				</li>
				<li>
					Comments on news posts are now viewable (but not yet editable) by non-wave users thanks to an awesome (and extremely fast) wave reader by Antimatter15.
				</li>
				<li>
					And on the code side of things
					<ul>
						<li>
							My home page has been updated to HTML5.  This does not mean much on the user interface side of things (yet), but things like the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> tags help bots make more sense of the page.  Unfortunately this may cause a few problems for Internet Explorer users (IE is the only modern browser that does not support HTML5), but this can be solved with <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">Google Chrome Frame</a>.
						</li>
						<li>
							I am organizing my stylesheets better to make formatting more consistant across the site (exceptions include certain computer help and video game pages).
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			I hope to bring some of the improvements (especially the navigation bar) to other parts of my site.  Please let me know what you think of the changes be e-mailing me at <a href="mailto:zmyaro@gmail.com">zmyaro@gmail.com</a> or waving me at <span class="fakelink">zmyaro@googlewave.com</span>

			Wow, three posts in one week.  I am on a roll here!  Anyway, I wanted to point out that I am testing a system for commenting on news posts.  You may remember when I tried putting all the news posts on a wave and that did not work very well.  I am trying a new system that will not have posts in waves, but will instead use waves for just the comments.  If you have a Google Wave preview (not dev preview this time), take a look <a href="oldnews-wave.html">here</a>.  Currently only the three most recent posts have commenting available.  In the future I may add comment waves to older posts if people request it.  Please note that you may not add bots or gadgets to these comment waves (unless approved by me).  Also, please do not say anything offensive in your comments.  I will edit/remove any inappropriate comments.  Finally, remember that this is just a test, so do not expect it to be perfect!

			<b>2009-10-30</b> Observations: Companies' Responses To Windows 7
			<br/>
			<br/>
			The Windows 7 RC has been available for over seven months now, but people are just starting to modify their applications to take advantage of Windows 7's features.  Here are some I find particularly useful.
			<ul class="homewords">
				<li>
					Google Chrome takes over the default title bar, but since reasonably early this year it has supported Aero Snap (allowing a window to be restored by dragging the title bar down when the window is maximized, and resizing it in various ways by dragging it to different edges of the screen).  It has even added similar features for tabs.  Also, a bit more recently Chrome has gotten its own custom jump list (the menu you see when you right-click a program on your taskbar) with the ability to open a new standard or incognito window or to open a commonly visited or recently closed page.  <img src="oldnews_imgs/scrnshot.gif" onMouseOver="src = 'oldnews_imgs/chrome_win7_jump_list.png';" onMouseOut="src = 'oldnews_imgs/scrnshot.gif';" style="vertical-align:top;" alt="screenshot"/>
				</li>
				<li>
					While iTunes is not my primary media player, I still have to use it to sync my iPod and occasionally play music from it when I am creating playlists for my iPod.  One day I did something I do all the time with Windows Media Player 12: I hovered over iTunes on the taskbar when I wanted to change the song.  To my surprise, I saw this: <img src="oldnews_imgs/scrnshot.gif" onMouseOver="src = 'oldnews_imgs/itunes_win7_thumb_btns.png';" onMouseOut="src = 'oldnews_imgs/scrnshot.gif';" style="vetical-align:top;" alt="screenshot"/>  It appears that iTunes 9 has the same thumbnail buttons as WMP12 as well as a jump list with options to open or search the iTunes store.  It does not, however, have WMP's "Play all music" or "Resume last playlist" options, nor does it have a list of frequently played songs/videos/playlists.  Unfortunately iTunes has yet to support Aero Snap properly.
					<br/>
					EDIT: iTunes now sort of supports Aero Snap.
				</li>
				<li>
					Steam just got updated a few days ago (finally) with decent support for Windows 7.  Valve may have waited until the last minute to do this, but they did a pretty nice job.  Steam now has a jump list that can quickly take you to a certain tab (Store, My Games, News, Community, or Friends), allow you to set your status (Online, Away, Busy, or Offline), or start a recently played game.  You can also pin games.  Here is a picture of it: <img src="oldnews_imgs/scrnshot.gif" onMouseOver="src = 'oldnews_imgs/steam_win7_jump_list.png';" onMouseOut="src = 'oldnews_imgs/scrnshot.gif';" style="vertical-align:top;" alt="screenshot"/>  One other feature that was added that I have not seen in any other program but Windows Explorer is having the taskbar icon double as a loading bar when you are downloading or updating a game <img src="oldnews_imgs/scrnshot.gif" onMouseOver="src = 'oldnews_imgs/steam_win7_loading_bar.png';" onMouseOut="src = 'oldnews_imgs/scrnshot.gif';" style="vertical-align:top;" alt="screenshot"/>  Unfortunately, Steam still has no support for Aero Snap.

			Sorry about not doing much here recently.  Been busy with other stuff (school, inProd, a little gaming if I ever have a free moment (which does not happen often thanks to the first two)).  I can tell you that at inProd, we are working on something really awesome.  I cannot give any details, but trust me, you are really going to like it.  I have also finished some nice updates to the <a href="http://inprod.co">inProd website</a> and my <a href="comp/school/math/index.html">math-on-computer tutorials</a> section (which I hope to expand at some point to general school-on-computer topics).
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Anyway, now that I have explained why I have not updated the site in so long, I thought I might rant for a little.  I actually have a few rants that I will hopefully post some time soon (assuming I have another few minutes of free time), but I decided put up this one since we are about two months (give or take depending on where you live) into the school year and are once again dealing with good, not-so-good, and just plain bad classes and teachers.  Please note that many of my rants are written so that there will be some disagreement.  I will try to put up pages for comments.  Unfortunately, this will only be open to Google Wave users.  Anyway, here we go...

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is how school works: You ride a bus to a (relatively) big building.  You go to a room full of desks and chairs and learn information from a teacher.  At various points during the day, you might go to a different room, also filled with desks and chairs, and learn things from a different teacher.  After several hours of this, you leave the building, get on a bus again, and go home.  At least, that is how school os <i>supposed</i> to work.  How does school not follow that?  That minor detail of "...and learn information from a teacher."  For some reason, it seems like few teachers actually <i>teach</i>.  And of those who do, many of them show signs that seem to indicate that they do not do their jobs very well.  Let me explain by going through a few classes I am taking or have taken.
			<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One great example was biology.  I can barely remember anything that was actually taught to us by our teacher.  Most of the year consisted of reading from a textbook, possibly being given a lecture (i.e. the teacher read off some PowerPoint slides that always seemed to have errors even though she claimed she had been using them for several years), and then taking a test.  And later in the year, the lectures were removed, leaving taking notes from the textbook and taking tests.  The only times we did labs were when we had a visitor and when the school or county required it.
			<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is my current world history class.  We are expected to read approximately ten pages from the textbook and write a &ldquo;response&rdquo; every night.  On top of that, our discussions in class are often not directly related to the readings but are more philosophical.  This would be great, except the material on the tests is not about what we talked about in class!  It is only the information from the textbook.
			<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more example.  In Japanese class last year, we would usually learn things based on the textbook but not only from the textbook.  This year, however, we are expected to teach ourselves from the book and take tests almost every class.  You have probably noticed that in all three of the examples, the material that the teacher seems to think is important, the material that we get tested on, the material that our grades depend on <i>comes from a book</i>.  So if we just learn from textbooks, why not fire those teachers?  It is not as though the school system just has extra money to throw away!  Also since we are expected to do this reading at home, then why can I not leave school ninety minutes earlier for every class with a non-teaching-teacher?
			<br/>
			<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now those examples above are a bit extreme.  I will give some less severe, but more common cases.  Here there will probably be a bit more argument.  One is pretty much every math class I have had since sixth or seventh grade.  Essentially each day the teacher teaches us a lesson, we do some problems that use what we were taught, and then we go home and do homework relating to that lesson.  The thing is that maybe in middle school, where classes were only fourty-six minutes it made sense to require that some work be done out of class.  But in high school classes are twice as long!  And yet still we have to do work at home.  Often enough work to fill another full class period.  Do my math teachers feel that they are not good enough to be able to teach me something given over an hour?  Especially something that I have already been taught twice (and in a few cases two years before by her!) and know well enough to teach myself.   I understand that some students do not pick up math as fast as some of my friends and I do, but is that not the point of separating the math classes?  Is that not the point of having a whole separate <i>school</i> for math/science/tech. geeks?  And if something does need &ldquo;reenforcing,&rdquo; maybe the teacher should try to teach it more clearly.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I often get annoyed when people complain without giving a solution, so I will list some examples of classes that seem to do things correctly.  The first is my computer science class last year.  Every day the teacher would explain some topic, possibly give us an assignment to complete that day or by a certain date (usually the end of the week or the end of the quarter).  We would often spend about half of each class period in the computer lab working on our programs.  We would occasionally have tests on things we had been doing.  The only homework was usually either extra credit or if you were taking an especially long time on a particular program.  There is not textbook, but the teacher recommended a programming book for anyone who <i>had</i> to have a book associated with the class.
			<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example: Design and Tech.  At the beginning of the year, we would spend each day learning about something, whatever that something may be.  Eventually we would start a project, often based on that something we had been learning about.  We would work each period on that project.  Eventually the project would be due and we would start on something else.  We would occasionally be tested on whatever we had been learning about.  The only homework was if you were studying for a test or had to do extra work on a project (and the latter was usually because you <i>wanted</i> to).
			<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more example is my AI class this year.  Each day we start by getting a mini-lecture (usually accompanied by a non-PowerPoint presentation and a lot of drawing and writing on a whiteboard) about whatever we are working on.  Each day's lecture usually builds off the previous day's.  The second half of each class is spent programming.  There is no homework besides working on your programs if you choose to.  Quizzes are common, but are very short and mainly test your knowledge of computer science or Python.  There is a textbook, but the teacher neve uses it.  He just tells us in case anyone wants to use it.
			<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You probably noticed some major differences between these examples and the ones above.  One is that the teachers teach us everything we learn.  They do not force us to read from a textbook and at most just mention it as an option for those who require reenforcement of what was learned in class.  Similarly there is rarely required homework.   All teaching, normal reenforcing, and work is done in class.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly it is possible to have a class in which the teacher teaches, everything is taught <i>during</i> class, and school and home stay separate.  So why can this not happen in all classes?

					Why is it that while sites like Google, Ask.com, and Wikipedia, as well as some other smaller, lesser-known sites have at minimum special pages to be viewed on mobile devices and in some cases, different buttons, images, and page formatting (and sometimes JavaScript) specifically designed for the iPhone and iPod touch, but Apple's website (the site belonging to the company that <i>made</i> the iPhone) is not designed at all for compatibility with the iPhone?

					Why is it that <i>The Journeyman Project: Turbo</i> and <i>The Journeyman Project 2: Buried In Time</i>, two games designed for Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, do not work on Windows XP but work on Windows 7 (RC) without compatibility mode?  Yes, this is true.  I discovered it today.  Please let me know if you know how to get either of these games to run on XP.

			<b>2009-08-25: I am back + some thoughts about the world</b>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			First of all, I am back.  Camp was awesome.  Woot 'Rah '09, Hudes and Eddie were generals!!, yay Red team!, &ldquo;So many milk squads...&rdquo; and so on.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			I will begin my rant by talking about something that everyone who knows me is probably sick of hearing about: Google Wave.  One of the many things I love about Wave is one of the reasons it was created, which is that some people realized that something that everyone knows and accepts (e-mail) has stayed almost the same while its environment (the Internet) has evolved around it could be improved.  Something I have wondered is why does this happen so rarely.  I know that I personally cannot always think of how to improve something simply because I am used to it as it is, but the problem is that most people do not even <i>try</i>!  I think more rules and ways, especially ones that have been around for decades or centuries, should be rethought.  Sometimes some of those things have lasted that long because they are good and they work, but in other cases they still exist only because everyone is so used to them that no one bothers to look for a better way.  <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;font-size:16pt;">FINISH</span>

			<b>2009-07-17:</b> A friend of mine created a map for <i>Team Fortress 2</i> (you may remember that I made one a few months ago and recently released an alpha version.  The interesting thing about his map is that he does not own TF2 and built the map in the <i>Portal</i> map editor.  After some--scratch that, a TON--of retexturing and some changes to accomodate the differences in size between Chell and the Heavy in the TF2 map editor on my PC, the map was somewhat playable.  We are now at alpha 5.1 and the map is looking pretty good.  We have not been able to test it on a "real" server (i.e. the best we have had is 1-on-11 over LAN) so we do not know how well the map plays, but it looks like it should work pretty well.

	<h1>Rant: Comments on the <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> movie</h1>
	<small>2009-07-15</small>
</header>
		<p>
			I saw the new <i>Harry Potter</i> movie this morning (the only reason I woke up before noon).  These are my feelings about it.  I personally thought this was the worst of the books.  The main reason was that it seemed written just to be a movie, and not to be good <i>Harry Potter</i> story.  There was soo much focus on the relationships instead of whatever it is that makes the other books exciting.  Sadly, this was one of the few ways this movie stayed true to the book.  As someone who likes these sort of movies to be true to the books they are based on, I have had complaints about all the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies.  The exclusion of Snape's potion riddle in the first, the exclusion of the deathday party in the second, unnecessary changes in the third and fifth, confusing skips in the fourth, and the exclusion of Hogsmeade from the fifth (just to name a few).  The fourth would probably have been the best, except that it skipped too fast from event to event.  Oh, and that the maze was completely messed up.  Still, I think the first (and second) movie(s) did a great job of bringing the magical world of Harry Potter to life.  The third made a few changes, but was still overall quite good.  They started going downhill from there, though.  For whatever reason, someone at Warner Brothers has something against house elves (which should have been in, but were excluded from the fourth and sixth movies), characters having consistant hair length, and keeping a director.  The fifth almost brought the series back to the level of the third, but now David Yates (director of #5 and #6) has brought the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies back into their decline.  Honestly, I was hating this movie from almost the very start.  I was happy to see them showing the destruction of the bridge, as mentioned in the book (even if that scene seems to have replaced the chapter "The Other Minister"), but the whole train station part was completely random.  It was not in the book and personally I thought the book's version of Dumbledore picking up Harry was much better and funnier.  From the Slughorn scene on, it was good even if some things were changed around a little bit.  My only complaints from then until later were the interactions between Harry and Ginny, the lack of fire and other effects in the Unbreakable Vow scene (I expected the makers of the movie to be HAPPY to have a scene designed for effects like that), and the Borgin and Burkes scene.  Malfoy was supposed to go alone and look at the cabinet, not have some huge ceremony.  From then until later it was fine (except that it should have been Tonks who found Harry).  From then until Christmas, I have no comaplaints except that I would have like to see a scene with Snape teaching.  The Christmas scene, however, was completely messed up.  There was not supposed to be Death Eaters burning the Burrow!  Nor should there have been Harry chasing Bellatrix or Ginny chasing him!  There <i>was</i> supposed to be the Minister of Magic, but I guess they forgot about him (just like they forgot about chapter one).  Later on, I want to know why they added in the scene with Harry and Ginny in the Room of Requirement and removed Griffindor winning the quidditch cup.  Finally, the ending was somewhat disappointing.  The cave was okay (although the last part was overly dramatic), and the part on top of the tower was great, but the ending was FAIL.  They removed Dumbledore's funeral in exchange for people holding up their wands and lighting up the sky for a second?!
		</p>
		<p>
			I agree with what I was told about the movie before I saw it: if you know nothing about the <i>Harry Potter</i> books and are just seeing it as a movie, then you will enjoy it.  If you are a fan of the series, you will not.
		</p>
		<p>
			While I know this will probably not happen, I would like to see Chris Columbus (director of the first two movies) come back for the last one.
