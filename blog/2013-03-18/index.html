				<h1>Rant: Google, Stop Killing Things - Part 3: What Will Be Next To Go?</h1>
				<time>2013-03-18</time>
			</header>
			
			<p>
				Since it is apparent Google's &ldquo;spring cleaning&rdquo; was not a one-time thing, I am starting to wonder what other Google products may be on the chopping block soon.  Here are some thoughts.
			</p>
			<h3><a href="http://feedburner.google.com" target="_blank">FeedBurner</a></h3>
			<p>
				The death of Google Reader AND iGoogle basically removes Google from the RSS game on the feed <em>reading</em> side, but FeedBurner is still around serving feeds.  Will Google choose to close down FeedBurner and abandon RSS completely, or do enough sites use FeedBurner to make it worth keeping around?
			</p>
			<h3><a href="https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas" target="_blank">Google Tasks</a></h3>
			<p>
				Google Tasks is a fantastic product.  It is conveniently built into Gmail and Google Calendar, and it has a lot of very nice mobile apps (even if none are from Google).  On the other hand, there has been zero activity on the product in quite a while&mdash;often a sign that Google is preparing to kill it.  In addition, the recently leaked Google Keep includes checklist functionality, which may replace Google Tasks.  Overall, though, I get the impression that Google Tasks is a product a lot of people use on a day-to-day basis, but not enough for it to influence Google.
			</p>
			<h3><a href="https://groups.google.com" target="_blank">Google Groups</a></h3>
			<p>
				I actually thought Google Groups was close to death a couple times in the past.  The recent redesigns have breathed some new life into it, but it still does not seem to be most people's go-to mailing list or forum solution outside of Google.  On top of that, Google seems to be pushing Google+Communities as its preferred way for users to communicate within a group.
			</p>
			<h3><a href="http://google.com/webfonts" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts</a></h3>
			<p>
				This is mostly on the grounds that Google Web Fonts still has its pre-Google+ UI, whereas nearly every surviving product that is not near death has seen a redesign.  It could be that Google recognizes that Web Fonts has a perfectly usable UI...or it could be that Google does not intend to continue working on its Web Fonts site.
			</p>
			<h3><a href="http://talk.google.com" target="_blank">Google Talk</a> <small>(as we know it)</small></h3>
			<p>
				Let me be clear: I am not predicting the death of Google Talk.  What I AM saying is I could see Google moving to a new instant messaging service that is not based on standards like XMPP.  Rumors of a new messaging service codenamed &ldquo;Babble&rdquo; have begun to surface, and it is likely we will see the future of Google chat services at I/O in May.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, Google Talk voice and video chat are likely to be shut down as they get replaced by Google+Hangouts.  When they work, I actually prefer Google Talk video chats over Hangouts&mdash;particularly on mobile where the app requires less resources&mdash;but Hangouts are definitely more reliable, and they are clearly where Google is focusing its engineering efforts.
