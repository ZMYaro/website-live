				<h1>SongZ Wrapped 2022</h1>
				<time>2023-01-02</time>
			</header>
			
			<p>
				As with last year, I know Spotify Wrapped happens at the beginning of December (and stops collecting data earlier), but I wanted to get my top played songs for all of 2022&mdash;most notably because there was some new music I only got at the end of the year.

			<p>
				As always, I enjoy doing this for all the interesting ways it can confirm or disprove my assumptions, and I also found it interesting to compare to last year's to see what has changed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Some miscellaneous observations include:
				<ul>
					<li>
						I am <em>not</em> surprised <i>Tick, Tick...BOOM!</i> did well.  I was initially surprised &ldquo;Come To Your Senses&rdquo; beat out &ldquo;Louder Than Words&rdquo; and &ldquo;30/90&rdquo;, but then I remembered the former is on my playlist for listening to while falling asleep, while the latter is (for obvious reasons) not.
					</li>
					<li>
						The <i>Star Trek: Prodigy</i> theme is my favorite new <i>Star Trek</i> theme since the '90s, but I was still surprised it made it to the top 5!
					</li>
					<li>
						The only reason the <i>Age Of Calamity</i> theme wasn't in my top 100 last year was because I had not added it to my library yet.
					</li>
					<li>
						(Ditto &ldquo;Read My Mind&rdquo; and the <i>Smash Bros.</i> Rainbow Road medley.)
					</li>
					<li>
						I think I expected at least one song from <i>Belle</i> to beat the <i>Mean Girls</i> musical since I remember enjoying the music from the former more (not that I <em>don't</em> enjoy &ldquo;World Burn&rdquo;).
					</li>
					<li>
						I am <em>not</em> surprised the Protomen cover of &ldquo;I Still Believe&rdquo; ranked highly.  I have no idea why I did not listen to <i>The Cover Up</i> much before this year despite having it in my library, but it is really good, and that was easily my favorite track from it this year.
					</li>
					<li>
						I am also not surprised <i>Splatoon</i> had some good representation with <i>Splatoon 3</i> releasing this year, and it will likely get a bit of a boost in the coming year if we get an official <i>Splatune 3</i>.  I <em>was</em> surprised &ldquo;Fresh Start&rdquo; made not only the top 100, but the top 50, beating out even &ldquo;Calamari Inkantation&rdquo;!
					</li>
					<li>
						I was not surprised my top 10 last year were not the same as my top 10 this year&mdash;I knew I listened to them less than I did in 2021&mdash;but I was surprised by how far some fell.  I was not surprised to see &ldquo;Paralyzed&rdquo; bumped down a little (I like it, but I was surprised it made #1), but I was very surprised &ldquo;Keep Coming Back To The Start&rdquo; did not make the top 100 at all this year, and a bit surprised to see neither did &ldquo;White Rabbit&rdquo; or &ldquo;White Woman's Instagram&rdquo;.  And just as shocking, &ldquo;Inferno&rdquo; somehow dropped from #5 to barely hanging on at #100!
					</li>
					<li>
						I also expected Sarah &amp; The Safe Word to fare better since I did not think I listened to them significantly less than 2021.  In particular, &ldquo;The Louisville Shuffle&rdquo; did not make the top 100 at all despite making it to #15 last year.
					</li>
					<li>
						Possibly the top reason I wanted to do a full year Wrapped instead of just through December 1<sup>st</sup> was I saw <i>Six</i> in December and got <em>very</em> into the soundtracks (UK Studio Recording <em>and</em> Live Broadway Recording).  I was curious whether any of them made the top 100 in that time, but only &ldquo;Don't Lose Ur Head&rdquo; did.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Incidentally, I checked my top 100 for just December, and <i>Six</i> held all of the top 9, and 16 of the top 20!
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						No matter when you cut it off, though, some album is going to get the short end of the stick.  <i>Hadestown</i> did not fare <em>too</em> poorly last year, but it probably would have done better if I had not seen it in November, splitting its peak listens between the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022.  By contrast, while I <em>did</em> listen to <i>Tick, Tick...BOOM!</i> more overall, it also benefited from its peak listens being in January.
					</li>
					<li>
						Once again, I expected more mashups to rank higher.
					</li>
					<li>
						There continues to be no good way to automate generating alt text for these screenshots.
					</li>
				</ul>
