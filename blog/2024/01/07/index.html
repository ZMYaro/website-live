				<h1>SongZ Wrapped 2023</h1>
				<time>2024-01-07</time>
			</header>
			
			<p>
				As with previous years, I know Spotify Wrapped happens at the beginning of December (and stops collecting data earlier), but I wanted to continue doing top songs for the whole year. Once again, there were newly acquired songs and newly revived hyperfixations only at the end of the year.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because several songs near the end had equal play counts, I decided to let them tie for #100.

			</div>
			<p>
				This year's miscellaneous observations include:
				<ul>
					<li>
						I certainly wasn't surprised to see <i>Tears Of The Kingdom</i> at the top or <i>Spider-Verse</i> and my favorite song from <i>So Much (For) Stardust</i> right behind it.  Those were easily some of my favorite media/events of the year.  Speaking of which...
					</li>
					<li>
						I also wasn't surprised to see my favorite song from the <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i> Booster Course Pass, one of my other favorite works of the year.  Absolute bop.
					</li>
					<li>
						And on that note, one of my favorite <i>Mario Kart</i> songs of all time right behind it since the Booster Course Pass got me solidly back on <i>Mario Kart</i> music in general.
					</li>
					<li>
						I wasn't surprised the brief return of my <i>Portal</i> hyperfixation brought <i>Portal</i> music to my top 100, but I was surprised &ldquo;You Wouldn't Know&rdquo; was the only one to make it, and so high!
					</li>
					<li>
						Most of the <i>Doctor Who</i> music on the list got there in December&mdash;some after the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary specials, but actually a lot only after the Christmas special!  The 1996 movie theme made it all the way to #4 (and &ldquo;The Shepherd's Boy to the top 20) in just the last 5 days of the year!
						<br />
						After <i>Six</i> and <i>Hadestown</i> not doing so well at the end of their years, this might be the most surprising in the top 10&mdash;or even top 20!
					</li>
					<li>
						I wasn't surprised some Sarah &amp; The Safe Word made the list (though I kind of expected more), but I was surprised &ldquo;Ruby Off The Rails&rdquo; wasn't the highest since it was the one that stuck in my head most from the new album.
					</li>
					<li>
						With all the other <i>Mario Kart</i> music, I was surprised the <i>Tour</i> version of &ldquo;Berlin Byways&rdquo; didn't make the list since that was another I listened to a lot.
					</li>
					<li>
						I was surprised &ldquo;Planet Of The Bass&rdquo; ended up so low with how much I listened to it when it came out, but I suppose the joke didn't last very long in hindsight.
					</li>
					<li>
						I wouldn't have expected the <i>Utena</i> theme to break into the top 100 at all, let alone as high as it did.  And if anything from <i>Utena</i> were going to, I would expect &ldquo;Zettai Unmei Mokushiroku&rdquo;.
					</li>
					<li>
						I was surprised &ldquo;The Wolf&rdquo; by Siamés and &ldquo;Coloris&rdquo; by She didn't make the list&mdash;they were a couple songs I got from a friend this year that I particularly enjoyed.
					</li>
					<li>
						I was also surprised by the lack of Porter Robinson because I recall listening to a fair bit.
					</li>
					<li>
						I was also surprised there wasn't any Taylor Swift (not counting mashups) because I listened to quite a bit around Spotify Wrapped time, and obviously <i>Doctor Who</i> proved a sufficiently determined late-year hyperfixation can break into the top 100.
					</li>
					<li>
						I don't know how noteworthy it is which soundtracks and hyperfixations didn't last.  Part of me is a little sad how little <i>Six</i> is on the list.
					</li>
					<li>
						After two years of saying I expected more mashups to rank higher, this year, the mashup spread feels about what I should have expected.
					</li>
					<li>
						There continues to be no good way to fully automate generating alt text for these screenshots, but a script I wrote did a <em>little</em> more of the work for me than last year.
					</li>
				</ul>
