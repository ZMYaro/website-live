			<p>
				I know Spotify Wrapped happens at the beginning of December (and stops collecting data earlier), but I wanted to get my top played songs for all* of 2021.

			<p>
				The most surprising thing to me this year was &ldquo;Paralyzed&rdquo; taking #1 by a decent margin&mdash;I know I was really into it for a bit, but I did not realize by how much.  #2 was less surprising, with Abigail Thorn making it my &ldquo;good vibes&rdquo; song of the year since introducing me to it at the end of January.  #3 and the general presence of Inside in the top 10 is also not so surprising.  &ldquo;White Rabbit&rdquo; making the top 100 is not surprising, but with <i>The Matrix: Resurrections</i> so late in the year, I am surprised it made it to #4!
			</p>
			<p>
				Other miscellaneous observations include:
				<ul>
					<li>I think I expected more mashups to make the top 100.</li>
					<li>If you know the names of the opening and credits songs, you can guess I watched <i>The Tatami Galaxy</i> this year.</li>
					<li>I did also rewatch <i>Promare</i> this year, but &ldquo;Inferno&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kakusei&rdquo; would have made the top 25 regardless.</li>
					<li>&ldquo;Montero&rdquo; would absolutely have ranked higher if the playthroughs from March 2021 had not been lost.</li>
					<li>There is no good way to automate generating alt text for these screenshots.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				(*A lot of data from October 2020-August 2021 did not make it to the final database, but this is as complete a top 100 as I can get.)
