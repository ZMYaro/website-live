				<p>
					These are just some random thoughts I have found somewhat interesting and written down.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						After eating&mdash;especially after eating dessert&mdash;it is a good idea to brush your teeth.  The problem is then the good taste of whatever you were eating gets replaced with the taste of toothpaste, which may not be a superior flavor.  Someone should invent some sort of flavored...thing (drink? tablet?)...that you can eat/drink after brushing your teeth that has one of any number of flavors, but that does not encourage bacteria to grow in your mouth.
					</li>
					<li>
						Pretty much no one buys fatty foods because they are fatty.  People usually buy unhealthful foods because they taste good.  Someone should sell snacks that have the appearence, taste, and texture of common unhealthful foods (e.g., chips, cake) that are actually made from very nutritious ingredients.  Artificial coloring and flavoring in food is already so common, that would probably be pretty easy.  I would think texture would be the most difficult to get right.
					</li>
					<li>
						When writing thank you notes, you generally do not write &ldquo;thank you for the money&rdquo; to someone who gave you money.  Rather, you write something like &ldquo;thank you for the generous gift.&rdquo;  Someone should make and sell thank you notes with &ldquo;thank you for the generous gift&rdquo; printed in them.
					</li>
					<li>
						How many stupid things are not, in some way, the result of uncontrolled emotion?
					</li>
					<li>
						Why is it that someone from Kenya is African, someone from China is Asian, someone from France is European, but someone from Canada is not American?
					</li>
					<li>
						Is a person who resists rape not eliminating a potential life?  Much like one who uses birth control?  Maybe we should stop trading in &ldquo;potential lives&rdquo;?
					</li>
					<li>
						Why are we told as children &ldquo;Do not say &lsquo;hate&rsquo;.  &lsquo;Hate&rsquo; is a strong word,&rdquo; but no one ever says &ldquo;Do not say &lsquo;love&rsquo;,&rdquo; when that implies about the same strength of emotion?
					</li>
					<li>
						Why are things &ldquo;written <b>down</b>&rdquo; but &ldquo;typed <b>up</b>&rdquo;?
					</li>
