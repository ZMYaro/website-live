					Values

					A constantly-in-progress attempt at a self-consistent set of personal values.

				This can be treated as an addition to my Open-Source Me Project&mdash;another part of me I am allowing people to see and (politely) engage with me on.  That said, though I have been adding to it as I have had time, it is not complete or comprehensive, so please bear that in mind if you choose to engage.

			<ul>
				<li>
					Every person should give some consideration to xer values, though making a list like this is definitely not expected.
				</li>
				<li>
					Every person should aim to have a self-consistent set of values.
				</li>
				<li>
					If two (or more) of your values are in conflict, you should figure out how to resolve it.
					<ul>
						<li>
							It is OK if the resolution is an exception for a particular case, but that should be done with careful consideration and precision.
						</li>
						<li>
							An exception should probably never be made around a specific person.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					If someone questions or disagrees with your values, you should at least give a moment's consideration to whether you need to reconsider them as the person suggests.
					<ul>
						<li>
							More than a moment if the person is one with whom you usually align, or whom you generally trust.
						</li>
						<li>
							More than a moment if the suggested reconsideration is widely held, especially by people with whom you usually align.
						</li>
						<li>
							It is OK to decide you were not mistaken in your values after that consideration.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					You should make an effort stand by your values even when others around you are in conflict with them.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Even your friends.
						</li>
						<li>
							Even your family.
						</li>
						<li>
							Even people you admire.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you believe yourself unable to stand by your values in a given situation (e.g., because doing so would jeopardize your relationship with your employer, and you cannot afford to do that), that is OK, but you still need to acknowledge to yourself that you are acting against your values in that situation and ensure that remains the exception and not the norm.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					You do not need to hold other people to <em>all</em> your personal values.
					<ul>
						<li>
							You should consider which of your values make sense to try to convince others to hold as well.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Believing in your values means extremely little if your actions do not reflect them.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<hr />
			
			<a name="basics"></a>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Every living human deserves to be seen as a person, and deserves basic rights.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Yes, even those ones.
						</li>
						<li>
							Yes, even those ones.
						</li>
						<li>
							Yes, even that one.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Every person should be able to access to what xe needs to survive (food, water, shelter, health care, etc.) regardless of wealth or ability.  If the society in which xe lives does not have enough of a resource to provide it to everyone, it should seek to become able to.
					<ul>
						<li>
							Health care means all health care.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Basic education should also be available to every person regardless of wealth or ability.
				</li>
				<li>
					Every person should be able to do what xe wants with xer body if it does not hurt anyone else.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<hr />
			
			<a name="orgs"></a>
			<ul>
				<li>
					An organization built around a single person should be seen as being as fragile as a single person.
				</li>
				<li>
					The highest paid role in an organization should not be paid more than 4&times; the lowest.
					<ul>
						<li>
							If a person is paid more than that, it should be because xe is doing all the work of multiple roles, thus being paid for each.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<hr />
			
			<a name="truth"></a>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Knowingly lying to someone is wronging that person.
				</li>
				<li>
					Correcting the wrong of lying to someone should involve not just correcting the lie, but also, where possible, the consequences of it being spread.
				</li>
				<li>
					Unknowningly passing on misinformation is not the same as lying.
					<ul>
						<li>
							You should still attempt to correct the misinformation and consequences of it being spread, but you do not have the same onus as if you had knowingly lied.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<hr />
			
			<a name="commitments"></a>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Explicitly made commitments trump implicitly assumed commitments.
				</li>
				<li>
					Violating a commitment made to someone is wronging that person.
				</li>
				<li>
					The extent to which you hold one to a commitment should be proportional to how able the person was to consent to making the commitment at the time.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<small>I.e. was xe misunderstanding, distracted, exhausted, inebriated, etc.</small>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Being related to someone&mdash;by biologically or legally&mdash;is not a commitment to that person unless you consent to it being.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you must back out of a commitment, you have an obligation to communicate it to the person, and you should provide context if you are able.
				</li>
				<li>
					If someone must back out of a commitment made to you, and xe provides context, cut the person an appropriate amount of slack given the nature of the commitment vs. the reason for xer backing out.
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<hr />
			
			<a name="retribution"></a>
			<ul>
				<li>
					If you think someone else should feel wronged by another person's actions, but xe does not, consider you may be mistaken or unaware of the entire situation.  Proceed with consideration.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<small>Past this point, for the sake of brevity, references to wrongs committed assume the wronged party feels wronged.</small>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					&ldquo;Feeling uncomfortable&rdquo;, on its own, is insufficient grounds to say a person has wronged you, deny xem rights, or exclude xem from a collective entity.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<small>If you are questioning this, consider how frequently that is used against non-white people, queer people, or neurodivergent people.</small>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Violation of &ldquo;unwritten rules&rdquo; or the like, on its own, is insufficient grounds to say a person has wronged you, deny xem rights, or exclude xem from a collective entity.
					<ul>
						<li>
							<small>If you are questioning this, consider how frequently that is used to discriminate against neurodivergent people or people raised in other cultures.</small>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					You have no right to expect someone to know xe has wronged you or attempt to correct the wrong if xe has not been informed.
				</li>
				<li>
					If someone is being wronged by another person, you should speak against it.
					<ul>
						<li>
							If you are able, you should actively prevent it, but you are not obligated to at the cost of your own physical safety or well-being.
						</li>
						<li>
							If you believe yourself unable to prevent it for another reason (e.g., because doing so would jeopardize your relationship with your employer, and you cannot afford to do that), that is OK, but you still need to acknowledge to yourself that you are allowing the wrong to continue and ensure that remains the exception and not the norm.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Every person who has wronged someone in a way that is deemed redeemable should have the opportunity for redemption.
					<ul>
						<li>
							That path to redemption does not need to happen around the wronged party(/ies) or parties xe may pose a danger to prior to rehabilitation.
						</li>
						<li>
							Once the person has earned redemption, the wronged party(/ies) should stop holding xer past actions over xer head.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					Consequences for a wrong committed should facilitate reversing the wrong, if possible, and helping the person not commit the same offense in the future.
					<ul>
						<li>
							A consequence that primarily serves to make the person feel punished says more about the person inflicting the punishment than the person being punished.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					If you deem an act so irredeemable the person who committed it can never reintegrate with society, you must be OK with killing that person.
				</li>
				<li>
					You are justified in being upset with someone for a wrong committed against you as long as it continues to affect you, but no longer.
				</li>
