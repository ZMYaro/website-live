			<p>
				In this case &ldquo;frequently&rdquo; means &ldquo;asked enough times that I put it here so you can stop asking.&rdquo;  that does not mean I hate all of these questions, it just means that there is now a way to get your answers without asking me in person.  Anyway, here we go.
			<p>
			<br/>
			<section>
				<b>Q:</b> What is your favorite programming language?
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> It really depends on the project.  I generally like using HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript, but that is not optimal for GUI-less programs and code that needs access to things on the computer.  For quick little programs I tend to use Python.  For larger things I will probably use Java.  For things that require fancy graphics I will probably use Flash (with ActionScript 3).
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> What do you mean when you call yourself a &ldquo;manual blogger&rdquo;?
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> I mean that my blog is (was) entirely manual.  I added each post to the news page, my home page, the RSS feed manually.  In a recent update I made a small change so that all news posts are contained in a single text file that is converted into HTML with JavaScript.  This makes it a bit easier to add (and view) posts while still giving me 100% control.  I will admit I have moved away slightly from being completely manual with the wave versions of my blog posts, but wave is worth it.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> Why are your answers so long?
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> Yeah, I do that too much.  I apologize.  I will try to keep them shorter.
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<b>Q:</b> Will you fix my computer/printer/phone/...?
				<br />
				<br />
				<b>A:</b> Maybe, if you agree to not blame me for anything that goes wrong.  Likely no.
				<br />
				<br />
				<br />
				<b>Q:</b> Will you write/design a website/program for me?
				<br />
				<br />
				<b>A:</b> Will you provide an incentive?
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> Why do you dislike Facebook?
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> It makes it very easy to join and import information, but much more difficult to get any of your data back out.  I also dislike a product being based on the idea that you should do something just because 100 other people did.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> What do you mean when you say FB is mind control?
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> If an admin sent a message to every FB user saying the best video of someone standing on xer head wins 500 &ldquo;Facebook points,&rdquo; a lot of people would stand on their heads.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> Why do you dislike emotions?
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> <i>Uncontrolled</i> emotion is the cause of many stupid things.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> Why do you dislike religion?
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> I dislike most religions (particularly theistic) because, they cause people to deny logic in favor of &ldquo;faith&rdquo; and because they are used as excuses for many terrible acts.  I think things like building communities, helping people, and morals can exist without deities.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> How can you be Jewish and agnostic?
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> I am Jewish in the sense that I follow the culture without most of the religion.  I do not see the Bible as non-fiction.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> You are going to hell for that!
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> Mmmm...toasty!  But seriously, if you consider a Dante-esque hell logically, it does not seem like it would be that terrible.  The worse torture would likely be boredom.  Also, a lot of awesome people will be there.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> Why do you hate so many things?
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> Everyone hates things.  They just hate some things less, and they are better than me at keeping their mouths shut.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> What are those four-digit codes you use?
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> They are created using a system I made to turn almost any word into a four-digit code.  I usually use them as shorthand ways to refer to projects or entities.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> ASDF
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> AOEU
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> JKL;
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> BLASPHEMY!
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Q:</b> Are we done here?
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>A:</b> Yes.
